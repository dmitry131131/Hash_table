which
represented
the

until
although
intel
created
the

was
not
until
the
success
of

the
partnership
between
microsoft

known
as
wintel
became
instrumental
in
shaping
the
pc
landscape
and
solidified
intels
position
on
the
market
as
a
result
intel
invested
heavily
in
new
microprocessor
designs
in
the
mid
to
late
s
fostering
the
rapid
growth
of
the
computer
industry
during
this
period
it
became
the

microprocessors
and
was
known
for
aggressive
and
anticompetitive
tactics
in
defense
of
its
market
position
particularly
against
amd
as
well
as
a
struggle
with
microsoft
for
control
over
the
direction
of
the
pc
industry
since
the
s
and
especially
the
late
s
intel
has
faced
increasing
competition
from
amd
resulting
in
a
significant
decline
of
its
dominance
and
market
share
in

nevertheless
with

of
and
they
have
faced
delays
for
their

according
to
former
intel
ceo
bob
swan
the
delay
was
caused
by
the
companys
overly
aggressive
strategy
for
moving
to
its
next
node
in
the
s
intel
was
among
the
worlds
top

years
later
intel
became

intels
third

was
andy

a
chemical

who
later
ran
the
company
through
much
of
the
s
and
the
highgrowth
s
in
deciding
on
a
name
moore
and
noyce
quickly
rejected
moore
noyce
near
homophone
for
more
noise
an
illsuited
name
for
an
electronics
company
since
noise
in
electronics
is
usually
undesirable
and
typically
associated
with
bad
interference
instead
they
founded
the
company
as
nm
electronics
or
mn
electronics
on
july
but
by
the
end
of
the
month
had
changed
the
name
to
intel
which
stood
for
integrated
electronicsnote
since
intel
was
already
trademarked
by
the
hotel
chain
intelco
they
had
to
buy
the
rights
for
the
name
early
history
at
its
founding
intel
was
distinguished
by
its
ability
to
make
logic
circuits
using
semiconductor
devices
the
founders
goal
was
the
semiconductor
memory
market
widely
predicted
to
replace
magneticcore
memory
its
first
product
a
quick
entry
into
the
small
highspeed

market
in
was
the
schottky

static
randomaccess
memory
sram
which
was
nearly
twice
as
fast
as
earlier
schottky
diode
implementations
by
fairchild
and
the
electrotechnical
laboratory
in
tsukuba
japan
in
the
same
year
intel
also
produced
the
schottky
bipolar

and
the
first
commercial

while
the
was
a
significant
advance
its

implemented
in
the

dram
the

these
issues
the

the
bestselling
semiconductor
memory
chip
in
the
world
by
as
it
replaced
core
memory
in
many
applications
intels
business
grew
during
the

as
it
expanded

improved
its
manufacturing
processes
and
produced
a
wider

intel
created
the
first
commercially
available
microprocessor
the
intel
in
the
microprocessor
represented
a
notable
advance
in
the
technology
of
integrated
circuitry
as
it
miniaturized
the
central
processing
unit
of
a
computer
which
then
made
it
possible
for
small
machines
to
perform
calculations
that
in
the
past
only
very
large
machines
could
do
considerable
technological
innovation
was
needed
before
the
microprocessor
could
actually
become
the
basis
of
what
was
first
known
as
a
mini
computer
and
then
known
as
a
personal
computer
intel
also
created
one
of

in
china
india
and
costa

in
the

by
the
early

its
business
was
dominated
by
dram

however
increased
competition
from
japanese
semiconductor
manufacturers
had
by
dramatically
reduced
the
profitability
of
this
market
the
growing
success
of
the
ibm
personal
computer
based
on
an
intel
microprocessor
was
among
factors
that
convinced
gordon
moore
ceo
since
to
shift
the
companys
focus
to
microprocessors
and
to
change
fundamental
aspects
of
that
business
model
moores
decision
to
solesource
intels

played
into
the
companys
continuing
success
by
the

buoyed
by
its
fortuitous
position
as
microprocessor
supplier
to
ibm

ibms
competitors
within
the
rapidly

intel
embarked
on
a

period
of
unprecedented
growth
as
the
primary

most
profitable
hardware
supplier
to
the

moore
handed

market
garnered
significant
market
share
initially
in
lowend

midrange
processors
but
ultimately
across
the
product
range
and
intels
dominant
position
in
its
core
market
was
greatly
reduced
mostly
due
to
controversial
netburst
microarchitecture
in
the
early
s
thenceo
craig
barrett
attempted
to
diversify
the
companys
business
beyond

but
few
of
these
activities
were
ultimately
successful

intel
had
also
for
a
number
of
years
been
embroiled
in
litigation
us

not
initially
recognize

association
sia
during
the
late
s
and
s
after
this
law
was
passed
intel
also
sued
companies
that
tried
to
develop
competitor

to
the
cpu
the
lawsuits
were
noted
to
significantly
burden
the
competition
with
legal
bills
even
if
intel
lost
the

antitrust
allegations
had
been
simmering

been
the

era
intels
profits
came
under
increased
pressure
from

manufacturers
and
thenpresident
andy
grove
focused
the
company
on
microprocessors
grove
described
this
transition
in
the
book
only
the

survive
a
key
element
of
his
plan
was
the
notion
then
considered
radical
of
becoming
the
single
source
for
successors
to
the
popular
microprocessor
until
then
the
manufacture
of
complex
integrated
circuits
was
not
reliable
enough
for
customers
to
depend
on
a
single
supplier
but
grove
began
producing
processors
in
three
geographically
distinct
factorieswhich
and
ceased
licensing
the
chip
designs
to
competitors
such
as

was
the
newly

though
the

intel
extended

during
this
period
andrew
grove
dramatically
redirected
the
company
closing
much
of
its
dram
business
and
directing
resources
to
the
microprocessor
business
of
perhaps
greater
importance
was
his
decision
to
singlesource
the
microprocessor
prior
to
this
microprocessor
manufacturing
was
in
its
infancy
and
manufacturing
problems
frequently
reduced
or
stopped
production
interrupting
supplies
to
customers
to
mitigate
this
risk
these
customers
typically
insisted
that
multiple
manufacturers
produce
chips
they
could
use
to
ensure
a
consistent
supply
the
and
series
microprocessors
were
produced
by
several
companies
notably
amd
with
which
intel
had
a
technologysharing
contract
grove
made
the
decision
not
to
license
the

to
other
manufacturers
instead
producing
it
in
three
geographically
distinct
factories
santa

california
hillsboro
oregon
and
chandler
a

he
convinced
customers
that
this
would
ensure
consistent

in
doing
this
intel
breached
its
contract
with
amd
which
sued
and
was
paid
millions
of
dollars
in
damages
but
could
not
manufacture
new
intel

any
longer
instead
amd
started
to
develop

manufacture
its

microprocessor
under
certain

the
loworder

of
the
result

be
incorrect
the

could
compound
in

intel
corrected
the
error
in
a
future
chip
revision
and
under
public
pressure
it
issued
a
total
recall
and
replaced
the
defective
pentium
cpus
which
were
limited
to
some
and
mhz

on
customer

the
bug
was
discovered
independently
in

by
thomas
nicely
professor
of

he
contacted
intel
but
received
no

on

he
posted
a

about
his
finding
on

word
of
the

spread
quickly
and
reached
the

press
the
bug
was
easy
to
replicate
a
user
could
enter
specific
numbers
into
the
calculator
on
the
operating

consequently
many
users
did
not
accept
intels
statements
that
the
error
was
minor
and
not
even
an
erratum
during
thanksgiving
in
the
new

times
ran
a
piece
by

john
markoff
spotlighting
the

intel
changed
its
position
and
offered
to
replace
every

quickly
putting
in
place
a
large
enduser
support
organization
this
resulted
in
a

dr

later
learned
that
intel
had
discovered
the

bug
in
its
own

a
few
months
before

but
had
decided
not

intels

on

steve

of
apple
announced
that
apple
would
be
transitioning
the
macintosh
from
its
long
favored
powerpc
architecture
to
the
intel
x
architecture
because
the
future
powerpc
road
map
was
unable
to
satisfy
apples
needs
this
was
seen
as
a
win
for
intel
although
an
analyst
called
the
move
risky
and
foolish
as
intels
current
offerings
at
the
time
were
considered
to
be
behind
those
of
amd
and
ibm
the
first
mac
computers
containing

were
announced
on

were

at

rumors

began
circulating
as
early

ceo
announced
that
it
would
be
transitioning
the
companys
entire
mac

from

cpus
to
custom
appledesigned
processors
based
on
the
arm
architecture
over
the
course
of
the
next
two
years
in
the
short
term
this
transition
was
estimated
to
have
minimal
effects
on
intel
as
apple
only
accounted
for
to
of
its
revenue
however
at
the
time
it
was
believed
that
apples
shift
to
its
own
chips
might
prompt
other
pc
manufacturers
to
reassess
their
reliance
on
intel

the

topics
initially

learned
that

the

open

support
intel
has
a
significant
participation
in
the
open

communities
since
selfpublished

for
example
in
intel
released
mitlicensed
xorg
drivers
for
their
integrated
graphic
cards
of
the
i
family
of

intel
released

drivers
for

were
also
ported
to

binary

released
under

licence
allowing

ran

project
until

when
they
handed
the

over

intel
also
runs
the

campaigns
however
after
the
release
of
the
wireless
products
called
intel
prowireless
bgbgabg
and
abg
in
intel
was
criticized
for
not
granting
free
redistribution
rights
for
the
firmware
that
must
be
included
in
the
operating
system
for
the
wireless
devices
to
operate
as
a
result
of
this
intel
became
a
target
of
campaigns
to
allow
free
operating
systems
to
include
binary
firmware
on
terms
acceptable
to
the
open
source
community
linspirelinux
creator
michael
robertson
outlined
the
difficult
position
that
intel
was
in
releasing
to
open
source
as
intel
did
not
want
to
upset
their
large
customer
microsoft
theo
de
raadt
of
openbsd
also
claimed
that
intel
is
being
an
open
source
fraud
after
an
intel
employee
presented
a
distorted
view
of
the
situation
at
an
open
source
conference
in
spite
of
the
significant
negative
attention
intel
received
as
a
result
of
the
wireless
dealings
the
binary
firmware
still
has
not
gained
a
license
compatible
with
free
software
principles
intel
has
also
supported
other
open

projects
such
as

corporate

logo
history
current
in
its
history
intel
has
had
three
logos
the
first
intel
logo
featured
the
companys
name
stylized
in
all
lowercase
with
the
letter
e
dropped
below
the
other
letters
the
second
logo
was
inspired
by
the
intel
inside
campaign
featuring
a
swirl
around
the
intel
brand
name
the
third
logo
introduced
in
was
inspired
by
the
previous
logos
it
removes
the
swirl
as
well
as
the
classic
blue
color
in
almost
all
parts
of
the
logo
except
for
the
dot
in
the
i

the
intel
inside
logo
used
from
to
the
intel
inside
logo
used
from
to
the
intel
inside
logo
used
from
to
continuously
underwent
a
minor
font
and
shade
of
color
modification
to
be
used
until
the
current
intel
inside
badge
has
been
used
since
it
is
also
adopted
as
the
umbrella
branding
to
promote
intels
lowend
processors
from
intel
has
become
one
of
the
worlds
most
recognizable
computer
brands
following
its
longrunning
intel
inside
campaign
the
idea
for
intel
inside
came
out
of
a
meeting
between
intel
and
one
of
the
major
computer
resellers
microage
in
the
late
s
intels
market
share
was
being
seriously
eroded
by
upstart
competitors
such
as
amd
zilog
and
others
who
had
started
to
sell
their
less
expensive
microprocessors
to
computer
manufacturers
this
was
because
by
using
cheaper
processors
manufacturers
could
make
cheaper
computers
and
gain
more
market
share
in
an
increasingly
pricesensitive
market
in
intels
dennis
carter
visited
microages
headquarters
in
tempe
arizona
to
meet
with
microages
vp
of
marketing
ron
mion
microage
had
become
one
of
the
largest
distributors
of
compaq
ibm
hp
and
others
and
thus
was
a
primary
although
indirect
driver
of
demand
for
microprocessors
intel
wanted
microage
to
petition
its
computer
suppliers
to
favor
intel
chips
however
mion
felt
that
the
marketplace
should
decide
which
processors
they
wanted
intels
counterargument
was
that
it
would
be
too
difficult
to
educate
pc
buyers
on
why
intel
microprocessors
were
worth
paying
more
for
mion
felt
that
the
public
did
not
really
need
to
fully
understand
why
intel
chips
were
better
they
just
needed
to
feel
they
were
better
so
mion
proposed
a
market
test
intel
would
pay
for
a
microage
billboard
somewhere
saying
if
youre
buying
a
personal
computer
make
sure
it
has
intel
inside
in
turn
microage
would
put
intel
inside
stickers
on
the
intelbased
computers
in
their
stores
in
that
area
to
make
the
test
easier
to
monitor
mion
decided
to
do
the
test
in
boulder
colorado
where
it
had
a
single
store
virtually
overnight
the
sales
of
personal
computers
in
that
store
dramatically
shifted
to
intelbased
pcs
intel
very
quickly
adopted
intel
inside
as
its
primary
branding
and
rolled
it
out
worldwide
as
is
often
the
case
with
computer
lore
other
tidbits
have
been
combined
to
explain
how
things
evolved
intel
inside
has
not
escaped
that
tendency
and
there
are
other
explanations
that
had
been
floating
around
intels
branding
campaign
started
with
the
computer
inside
tagline
in
in
the
us
and
europe
the
japan
chapter
of
intel
proposed
an
intel
in
it
tagline
and
kicked
off
the
japanese
campaign
by
hosting
ekikon
meaning
station
concert
in
japanese
at
the
tokyo
railway
station
dome
on
christmas
day
december
several
months
later
the
computer
inside
incorporated
the
japan
idea
to
become
intel
inside
which
eventually
elevated
to
the
worldwide
branding
campaign
in
by
intel
marketing
manager
dennis
carter
a
case
study
inside
intel
inside
was
put
together
by
harvard
business
school
the
fivenote
jingle
was
introduced
in
and
by
its
tenth
anniversary
was
being
heard
in
countries
around
the
world
the
initial
branding
agency
for
the
intel
inside
campaign
was
dahlinsmithwhite
advertising
of
salt
lake
city
the
intel
swirl
logo
was
the
work
of
dahlinsmithwhite
art
director
steve
grigg
under
the
direction
of
intel
president
and
ceo
andy
grovecitation
needed
the
intel
inside
advertising
campaign
sought
public
brand
loyalty
and
awareness
of
intel
processors
in
consumer
computers
intel
paid
some
of
the
advertisers
costs
for
an
ad
that
used
the
intel
inside
logo
and
xylomarimba
jingle
in
intel
planned
to
shift
the
emphasis
of
its
intel
inside
campaign
from
traditional
media
such
as
television
and
print
to
newer
media
such
as
the
internet
intel
required
that
a
minimum
of
of
the
money
it
provided
to
the
companies
in
its
coop
program
be
used
for
online
marketing
the
intel
annual
financial
report
indicated
that
billion
of
the
gross
margin
and
nearly
of
the
total
net
income
was
allocated
to
all
advertising
with
intel
