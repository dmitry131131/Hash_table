which
represented
the

until
although
intel
created
the

was
not
until
the
success
of

the
partnership
between
microsoft

known
as
wintel
became
instrumental
in
shaping
the
pc
landscape
and
solidified
intels
position
on
the
market
as
a
result
intel
invested
heavily
in
new
microprocessor
designs
in
the
mid
to
late
s
fostering
the
rapid
growth
of
the
computer
industry
during
this
period
it
became
the

microprocessors
and
was
known
for
aggressive
and
anticompetitive
tactics
in
defense
of
its
market
position
particularly
against
amd
as
well
as
a
struggle
with
microsoft
for
control
over
the
direction
of
the
pc
industry
since
the
s
and
especially
the
late
s
intel
has
faced
increasing
competition
from
amd
resulting
in
a
significant
decline
of
its
dominance
and
market
share
in

nevertheless
with

of
and
they
have
faced
delays
for
their

according
to
former
intel
ceo
bob
swan
the
delay
was
caused
by
the
companys
overly
aggressive
strategy
for
moving
to
its
next
node
in
the
s
intel
was
among
the
worlds
top

years
later
intel
became

intels
third

was
andy

a
chemical

who
later
ran
the
company
through
much
of
the
s
and
the
highgrowth
s
in
deciding
on
a
name
moore
and
noyce
quickly
rejected
moore
noyce
near
homophone
for
more
noise
an
illsuited
name
for
an
electronics
company
since
noise
in
electronics
is
usually
undesirable
and
typically
associated
with
bad
interference
instead
they
founded
the
company
as
nm
electronics
or
mn
electronics
on
july
but
by
the
end
of
the
month
had
changed
the
name
to
intel
which
stood
for
integrated
electronicsnote
since
intel
was
already
trademarked
by
the
hotel
chain
intelco
they
had
to
buy
the
rights
for
the
name
early
history
at
its
founding
intel
was
distinguished
by
its
ability
to
make
logic
circuits
using
semiconductor
devices
the
founders
goal
was
the
semiconductor
memory
market
widely
predicted
to
replace
magneticcore
memory
its
first
product
a
quick
entry
into
the
small
highspeed

market
in
was
the
schottky

static
randomaccess
memory
sram
which
was
nearly
twice
as
fast
as
earlier
schottky
diode
implementations
by
fairchild
and
the
electrotechnical
laboratory
in
tsukuba
japan
in
the
same
year
intel
also
produced
the
schottky
bipolar

and
the
first
commercial

while
the
was
a
significant
advance
its

implemented
in
the

dram
the

these
issues
the

the
bestselling
semiconductor
memory
chip
in
the
world
by
as
it
replaced
core
memory
in
many
applications
intels
business
grew
during
the

as
it
expanded

improved
its
manufacturing
processes
and
produced
a
wider

intel
created
the
first
commercially
available
microprocessor
the
intel
in
the
microprocessor
represented
a
notable
advance
in
the
technology
of
integrated
circuitry
as
it
miniaturized
the
central
processing
unit
of
a
computer
which
then
made
it
possible
for
small
machines
to
perform
calculations
that
in
the
past
only
very
large
machines
could
do
considerable
technological
innovation
was
needed
before
the
microprocessor
could
actually
become
the
basis
of
what
was
first
known
as
a
mini
computer
and
then
known
as
a
personal
computer
intel
also
created
one
of

in
china
india
and
costa

in
the

by
the
early

its
business
was
dominated
by
dram

however
increased
competition
from
japanese
semiconductor
manufacturers
had
by
dramatically
reduced
the
profitability
of
this
market
the
growing
success
of
the
ibm
personal
computer
based
on
an
intel
microprocessor
was
among
factors
that
convinced
gordon
moore
ceo
since
to
shift
the
companys
focus
to
microprocessors
and
to
change
fundamental
aspects
of
that
business
model
moores
decision
to
solesource
intels

played
into
the
companys
continuing
success
by
the

buoyed
by
its
fortuitous
position
as
microprocessor
supplier
to
ibm

ibms
competitors
within
the
rapidly

intel
embarked
on
a

period
of
unprecedented
growth
as
the
primary

most
profitable
hardware
supplier
to
the

moore
handed

market
garnered
significant
market
share
initially
in
lowend

midrange
processors
but
ultimately
across
the
product
range
and
intels
dominant
position
in
its
core
market
was
greatly
reduced
mostly
due
to
controversial
netburst
microarchitecture
in
the
early
s
thenceo
craig
barrett
attempted
to
diversify
the
companys
business
beyond

but
few
of
these
activities
were
ultimately
successful

intel
had
also
for
a
number
of
years
been
embroiled
in
litigation
us

not
initially
recognize

association
sia
during
the
late
s
and
s
after
this
law
was
passed
intel
also
sued
companies
that
tried
to
develop
competitor

to
the
cpu
the
lawsuits
were
noted
to
significantly
burden
the
competition
with
legal
bills
even
if
intel
lost
the

antitrust
allegations
had
been
simmering

been
the

era
intels
profits
came
under
increased
pressure
from

manufacturers
and
thenpresident
andy
grove
focused
the
company
on
microprocessors
grove
described
this
transition
in
the
book
only
the

survive
a
key
element
of
his
plan
was
the
notion
then
considered
radical
of
becoming
the
single
source
for
successors
to
the
popular
microprocessor
until
then
the
manufacture
of
complex
integrated
circuits
was
not
reliable
enough
for
customers
to
depend
on
a
single
supplier
but
grove
began
producing
processors
in
three
geographically
distinct
factorieswhich
and
ceased
licensing
the
chip
designs
to
competitors
such
as

was
the
newly

though
the

intel
extended

during
this
period
andrew
grove
dramatically
redirected
the
company
closing
much
of
its
dram
business
and
directing
resources
to
the
microprocessor
business
of
perhaps
greater
importance
was
his
decision
to
singlesource
the
microprocessor
prior
to
this
microprocessor
manufacturing
was
in
its
infancy
and
manufacturing
problems
frequently
reduced
or
stopped
production
interrupting
supplies
to
customers
to
mitigate
this
risk
these
customers
typically
insisted
that
multiple
manufacturers
produce
chips
they
could
use
to
ensure
a
consistent
supply
the
and
series
microprocessors
were
produced
by
several
companies
notably
amd
with
which
intel
had
a
technologysharing
contract
grove
made
the
decision
not
to
license
the

to
other
manufacturers
instead
producing
it
in
three
geographically
distinct
factories
santa

california
hillsboro
oregon
and
chandler
a

he
convinced
customers
that
this
would
ensure
consistent

in
doing
this
intel
breached
its
contract
with
amd
which
sued
and
was
paid
millions
of
dollars
in
damages
but
could
not
manufacture
new
intel

any
longer
instead
amd
started
to
develop

manufacture
its

microprocessor
under
certain

the
loworder

of
the
result

be
incorrect
the

could
compound
in

intel
corrected
the
error
in
a
future
chip
revision
and
under
public
pressure
it
issued
a
total
recall
and
replaced
the
defective
pentium
cpus
which
were
limited
to
some
and
mhz

on
customer

the
bug
was
discovered
independently
in

by
thomas
nicely
professor
of

he
contacted
intel
but
received
no

on

he
posted
a

about
his
finding
on

word
of
the

spread
quickly
and
reached
the

press
the
bug
was
easy
to
replicate
a
user
could
enter
specific
numbers
into
the
calculator
on
the
operating

consequently
many
users
did
not
accept
intels
statements
that
the
error
was
minor
and
not
even
an
erratum
during
thanksgiving
in
the
new

times
ran
a
piece
by

john
markoff
spotlighting
the

intel
changed
its
position
and
offered
to
replace
every

quickly
putting
in
place
a
large
enduser
support
organization
this
resulted
in
a

dr

later
learned
that
intel
had
discovered
the

bug
in
its
own

a
few
months
before

but
had
decided
not

intels

on

steve

of
apple
announced
that
apple
would
be
transitioning
the
macintosh
from
its
long
favored
powerpc
architecture
to
the
intel
x
architecture
because
the
future
powerpc
road
map
was
unable
to
satisfy
apples
needs
this
was
seen
as
a
win
for
intel
although
an
analyst
called
the
move
risky
and
foolish
as
intels
current
offerings
at
the
time
were
considered
to
be
behind
those
of
amd
and
ibm
the
first
mac
computers
containing

were
announced
on

were

at

rumors

began
circulating
as
early

ceo
announced
that
it
would
be
transitioning
the
companys
entire
mac

from

cpus
to
custom
appledesigned
processors
based
on
the
arm
architecture
over
the
course
of
the
next
two
years
in
the
short
term
this
transition
was
estimated
to
have
minimal
effects
on
intel
as
apple
only
accounted
for
to
of
its
revenue
however
at
the
time
it
was
believed
that
apples
shift
to
its
own
chips
might
prompt
other
pc
manufacturers
to
reassess
their
reliance
on
intel

the

topics
initially

learned
that

the

open

support
intel
has
a
significant
participation
in
the
open

communities
since
selfpublished

for
example
in
intel
released
mitlicensed
xorg
drivers
for
their
integrated
graphic
cards
of
the
i
family
of

intel
released

drivers
for

were
also
ported
to

binary

released
under

licence
allowing

ran

project
until

when
they
handed
the

over

intel
also
runs
the

campaigns
however
after
the
release
of
the
wireless
products
called
intel
prowireless
bgbgabg
and
abg
in
intel
was
criticized
for
not
granting
free
redistribution
rights
for
the
firmware
that
must
be
included
in
the
operating
system
for
the
wireless
devices
to
operate
as
a
result
of
this
intel
became
a
target
of
campaigns
to
allow
free
operating
systems
to
include
binary
firmware
on
terms
acceptable
to
the
open
source
community
linspirelinux
creator
michael
robertson
outlined
the
difficult
position
that
intel
was
in
releasing
to
open
source
as
intel
did
not
want
to
upset
their
large
customer
microsoft
theo
de
raadt
of
openbsd
also
claimed
that
intel
is
being
an
open
source
fraud
after
an
intel
employee
presented
a
distorted
view
of
the
situation
at
an
open
source
conference
in
spite
of
the
significant
negative
attention
intel
received
as
a
result
of
the
wireless
dealings
the
binary
firmware
still
has
not
gained
a
license
compatible
with
free
software
principles
intel
has
also
supported
other
open

projects
such
as

corporate

logo
history
current
in
its
history
intel
has
had
three
logos
the
first
intel
logo
featured
the
companys
name
stylized
in
all
lowercase
with
the
letter
e
dropped
below
the
other
letters
the
second
logo
was
inspired
by
the
intel
inside
campaign
featuring
a
swirl
around
the
intel
brand
name
the
third
logo
introduced
in
was
inspired
by
the
previous
logos
it
removes
the
swirl
as
well
as
the
classic
blue
color
in
almost
all
parts
of
the
logo
except
for
the
dot
in
the
i

the
intel
inside
logo
used
from
to
the
intel
inside
logo
used
from
to
the
intel
inside
logo
used
from
to
continuously
underwent
a
minor
font
and
shade
of
color
modification
to
be
used
until
the
current
intel
inside
badge
has
been
used
since
it
is
also
adopted
as
the
umbrella
branding
to
promote
intels
lowend
processors
from
intel
has
become
one
of
the
worlds
most
recognizable
computer
brands
following
its
longrunning
intel
inside
campaign
the
idea
for
intel
inside
came
out
of
a
meeting
between
intel
and
one
of
the
major
computer
resellers
microage
in
the
late
s
intels
market
share
was
being
seriously
eroded
by
upstart
competitors
such
as
amd
zilog
and
others
who
had
started
to
sell
their
less
expensive
microprocessors
to
computer
manufacturers
this
was
because
by
using
cheaper
processors
manufacturers
could
make
cheaper
computers
and
gain
more
market
share
in
an
increasingly
pricesensitive
market
in
intels
dennis
carter
visited
microages
headquarters
in
tempe
arizona
to
meet
with
microages
vp
of
marketing
ron
mion
microage
had
become
one
of
the
largest
distributors
of
compaq
ibm
hp
and
others
and
thus
was
a
primary
although
indirect
driver
of
demand
for
microprocessors
intel
wanted
microage
to
petition
its
computer
suppliers
to
favor
intel
chips
however
mion
felt
that
the
marketplace
should
decide
which
processors
they
wanted
intels
counterargument
was
that
it
would
be
too
difficult
to
educate
pc
buyers
on
why
intel
microprocessors
were
worth
paying
more
for
mion
felt
that
the
public
did
not
really
need
to
fully
understand
why
intel
chips
were
better
they
just
needed
to
feel
they
were
better
so
mion
proposed
a
market
test
intel
would
pay
for
a
microage
billboard
somewhere
saying
if
youre
buying
a
personal
computer
make
sure
it
has
intel
inside
in
turn
microage
would
put
intel
inside
stickers
on
the
intelbased
computers
in
their
stores
in
that
area
to
make
the
test
easier
to
monitor
mion
decided
to
do
the
test
in
boulder
colorado
where
it
had
a
single
store
virtually
overnight
the
sales
of
personal
computers
in
that
store
dramatically
shifted
to
intelbased
pcs
intel
very
quickly
adopted
intel
inside
as
its
primary
branding
and
rolled
it
out
worldwide
as
is
often
the
case
with
computer
lore
other
tidbits
have
been
combined
to
explain
how
things
evolved
intel
inside
has
not
escaped
that
tendency
and
there
are
other
explanations
that
had
been
floating
around
intels
branding
campaign
started
with
the
computer
inside
tagline
in
in
the
us
and
europe
the
japan
chapter
of
intel
proposed
an
intel
in
it
tagline
and
kicked
off
the
japanese
campaign
by
hosting
ekikon
meaning
station
concert
in
japanese
at
the
tokyo
railway
station
dome
on
christmas
day
december
several
months
later
the
computer
inside
incorporated
the
japan
idea
to
become
intel
inside
which
eventually
elevated
to
the
worldwide
branding
campaign
in
by
intel
marketing
manager
dennis
carter
a
case
study
inside
intel
inside
was
put
together
by
harvard
business
school
the
fivenote
jingle
was
introduced
in
and
by
its
tenth
anniversary
was
being
heard
in
countries
around
the
world
the
initial
branding
agency
for
the
intel
inside
campaign
was
dahlinsmithwhite
advertising
of
salt
lake
city
the
intel
swirl
logo
was
the
work
of
dahlinsmithwhite
art
director
steve
grigg
under
the
direction
of
intel
president
and
ceo
andy
grovecitation
needed
the
intel
inside
advertising
campaign
sought
public
brand
loyalty
and
awareness
of
intel
processors
in
consumer
computers
intel
paid
some
of
the
advertisers
costs
for
an
ad
that
used
the
intel
inside
logo
and
xylomarimba
jingle
in
intel
planned
to
shift
the
emphasis
of
its
intel
inside
campaign
from
traditional
media
such
as
television
and
print
to
newer
media
such
as
the
internet
intel
required
that
a
minimum
of
of
the
money
it
provided
to
the
companies
in
its
coop
program
be
used
for
online
marketing
the
intel
annual
financial
report
indicated
that
billion
of
the
gross
margin
and
nearly
of
the
total
net
income
was
allocated
to
all
advertising
with
intel

linus
torvalds
at
the
linuxcon
europe
in
dsseldorf
in
april
linus
torvalds
at
the
time
a
yearold
computer
science
student
at
the
university
of
helsinki
finland
started
working
on
some
simple
ideas
for
an
operating
system
inspired
by
unix
for
a
personal
computer
he
started
with
a
task
switcher
in
intel
assembly
language
and
a
terminal
driver
on
august
torvalds
posted
the
following
to
composminix
a
newsgroup
on
usenet
im
doing
a
free
operating
system
just
a
hobby
wont
be
big
and
professional
like
gnu
for
at
clones
this
has
been
brewing
since
april
and
is
starting
to
get
ready
id
like
any
feedback
on
things
people
likedislike
in
minix
as
my
os
resembles
it
somewhat
same
physical
layout
of
the
filesystem
due
to
practical
reasons
among
other
things
ive
currently
ported
bash
and
gcc
and
things
seem
to
work
this
implies
that
ill
get
something
practical
within
a
few
months
yes
its
free
of
any
minix
code
and
it
has
a
multithreaded
fs
it
is
not
protable
sic
uses
task
switching
etc
and
it
probably
never
will
support
anything
other
than
atharddisks
as
thats
all
i
have
on
september
torvalds
prepared
version
of
linux
and
put
on
the
ftpfunetfi
ftp
server
of
the
finnish
university
and
research
network
funet
it
was
not
even
executable
since
its
code
still
needed
minix
to
compile
and
test
it
on
october
torvalds
announced
the
first
official
version
of
linux
version
at
this
point
linux
was
able
to
run
bash
gcc
and
some
other
gnu
utilities
as
i
mentioned
a
month
ago
im
working
on
a
free
version
of
a
minixlookalike
for
at
computers
it
has
finally
reached
the
stage
where
its
even
usable
though
may
not
be
depending
on
what
you
want
and
i
am
willing
to
put
out
the
sources
for
wider
distribution
it
is
just
version
but
ive
successfully
run
bash
gcc
gnumake
gnused
compress
etc
under
it
after
that
despite
the
limited
functionality
of
the
early
versions
linux
rapidly
gained
developers
and
users
many
people
contributed
code
to
the
project
including
some
developers
from
the
minix
communitycitation
needed
at
the
time
the
gnu
project
had
created
many
of
the
components
required
for
its
free
unix
replacement
the
gnu
operating
system
but
its
own
kernel
gnu
hurd
was
incomplete
for
this
reason
it
soon
adopted
the
linux
kernel
as
well
the
berkeley
software
distribution
had
not
yet
freed
itself
from
legal
encumbrances
and
was
not
competing
in
the
space
for
a
free
os
kernel
torvalds
assigned
version
to
the
kernel
to
indicate
that
it
was
mainly
for
testing
and
not
intended
for
productive
use
version
released
in
december
was
the
first
selfhosted
linux
for
it
could
be
compiled
by
a
computer
running
the
same
kernel
when
torvalds
released
version
in
february
he
adopted
the
gnu
general
public
license
version
gplv
over
his
previous
selfdrafted
license
which
had
not
permitted
commercial
redistribution
in
contrast
to
unix
all
source
files
of
linux
are
freely
available
including
device
drivers
the
initial
success
of
linux
was
driven
by
programmers
and
testers
across
the
world
with
the
support
of
the
posix
apis
through
the
libc
that
whether
needed
acts
as
an
entry
point
to
the
kernel
address
space
linux
could
run
software
and
applications
that
had
been
developed
for
unix
the
linux
kernel
supports
various
hardware
architectures
providing
a
common
platform
for
software
including
proprietary
software
on
january
the
first
post
to
the
new
newsgroup
altoslinux
was
submitted
on
march
the
newsgroup
was
renamed
composlinux
the
fact
that
linux
is
a
monolithic
kernel
rather
than
a
microkernel
was
the
topic
of
a
debate
between
andrew
s
tanenbaum
the
creator
of
minix
and
torvalds
the
tanenbaumtorvalds
debate
started
in
on
the
usenet
group
composminix
as
a
general
discussion
about
kernel
architectures
linux
version
was
the
first
to
be
capable
of
running
the
x
window
system
in
march
linux
was
released
with
lines
of
code
it
was
the
first
version
suitable
for
use
in
production
environments
it
started
a
versioning
system
for
the
kernel
with
three
or
four
numbers
separated
by
dots
where
the
first
represented
the
major
release
the
second
was
the
minor
release
and
the
third
was
the
revision
at
that
time
oddnumbered
minor
releases
were
for
development
and
tests
whilst
even
numbered
minor
releases
were
for
production
the
optional
fourth
digit
indicated
a
set
of
patches
to
a
revision
development
releases
were
indicated
with
rc
release
candidate
suffix
the
current
version
numbering
is
slightly
different
from
the
above
the
even
vs
odd
numbering
has
been
dropped
and
a
specific
major
version
is
now
indicated
by
the
first
two
numbers
taken
as
a
whole
while
the
timeframe
is
open
for
the
development
of
the
next
major
the
rcn
suffix
is
used
to
identify
the
nth
release
candidate
for
the
next
version
for
example
the
release
of
the
version
was
preceded
by
seven
rcn
from
rc
to
rc
once
a
stable
release
is
made
its
maintenance
is
passed
off
to
the
stable
team
occasional
updates
to
stable
releases
are
identified
by
a
three
numbering
scheme
eg
after
version
of
the
kernel
torvalds
decided
that
linux
had
evolved
enough
to
warrant
a
new
major
number
so
he
released
version
in
june
the
series
included
releases
the
major
feature
of
was
support
for
symmetric
multiprocessing
smp
and
support
for
more
types
of
processors
starting
with
version
linux
is
configurable
for
selecting
specific
hardware
targets
and
for
enabling
architecturespecific
features
and
optimizations
the
make
config
family
of
commands
of
kbuild
are
used
to
enable
and
configure
thousands
of
options
for
building
ad
hoc
kernel
executables
vmlinux
and
loadable
modules
version
released
on
january
improved
locking
granularity
and
smp
management
added
mk
powerpc
sparc
alpha
and
other
bit
platforms
support
furthermore
it
added
new
file
systems
including
microsofts
ntfs
readonly
capability
in
ibm
published
its
patches
to
the
linux
code
for
the
support
of
the
s
architecture
version
released
on
january
contained
support
for
isa
plug
and
play
usb
and
pc
cards
linux
added
support
for
the
pentium
and
itanium
the
latter
introduced
the
ia
isa
that
was
jointly
developed
by
intel
and
hewlettpackard
to
supersede
the
older
parisc
and
for
the
newer
bit
mips
processor
development
for
x
changed
a
bit
in
that
more
features
were
made
available
throughout
the
series
including
support
for
bluetooth
logical
volume
manager
lvm
version
raid
support
intermezzo
and
ext
file
systems
version
was
released
on
december
the
development
for
x
changed
further
towards
including
new
features
throughout
the
series
among
the
changes
that
have
been
made
in
the
series
are
integration
of
clinux
into
the
mainline
kernel
sources
pae
support
support
for
several
new
lines
of

still
limited
to
substantially
increased
the
number
of

sources
selinux
integration
into
the

sources
infiniband
support
and
considerably
more
also
notable
are
the
addition
of
a
wide
selection
of
file
systems
starting
with
the
x
releases
now
the
kernel
supports
a
large
number
of
file
systems
some
that
have
been
designed
for
linux
like
ext
ext
fuse
btrfs
and
others
that
are
native
of
other
operating
systems
like
jfs
xfs
minix
xenix
irix
solaris
system
v
windows
and
msdos
in
the
stable
team
was
formed
as
a
response
to
the
lack
of
a
kernel
tree
where
people
could
work
on
bug
fixes
and
it
would
keep
updating
stable
versions
in
february
the
linuxnext
tree
was
created
to
serve
as
a
place
where
patches
aimed
to
be
merged
during
the
next
development
cycle
gathered
several
subsystem
maintainers
also
adopted
the
suffix
next
for
trees
containing
code
which
they
mean
to
submit
for
inclusion
in
the
next
release
cycle
as
of
january
the
indevelopment
version
of
linux
is
held
in
an
unstable
branch
named
linuxnext
linux
used
to
be
maintained
without
the
help
of
an
automated
source
code
management
system
until
in
development
switched
to
bitkeeper
it
was
freely
available
for
linux
developers
but
it
was
not
free
software
in
because
of
efforts
to
reverseengineer
it
the
company
which
owned
the
software
revoked
its
support
of
the
linux
community
in
response
torvalds
and
others
wrote
git
the
new
system
was
written
within
weeks
and
in
two
months
the
first
official

made
using
it
was

was
celebrated
by
torvalds
in

with
the
release
of
the

as
had
been
the

on

on

torvalds
announced
that
the
big
change
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
and
asked
lets
make
sure
we
really
make
the
next
release
not
just
an
all
new
shiny
number
but
a
good
kernel
too
after
the
expected
weeks
of
the
development
process
it
would
be
released
near
the
th
anniversary
of
linux
on
december
torvalds
decided
to
reduce
kernel
complexity
by
removing
support
for
i
processors
making
the
kernel
series
the
last
one
still
supporting
the
original
processor
the
same
series
unified
support
for
the
arm
processor
version
released
on

adds
many
new

such
as
new
otmpfile

the
purpose
of
specifying

support
for
posix

io
however
because
they
scale
poorly
with
multithreaded
applications
a
family
of
linux
specific
io

calls
io
had
to
be
created
for
the
management
of

suitable
for

the
linux

with

this

improves

sriov
combines
the

gains
of

this
device

as

the
set
of
the
linux
kernel
api
that
regards
the
interfaces
exposed
to
user
applications
is
fundamentally
composed
of
unix
and
linuxspecific
system
calls
a
system
call
is
an
entry
point
into
the
linux
kernel
for
example
among
the
linuxspecific
ones
there
is
the
family
of
the
clone
system
calls
most
extensions
must
be
enabled
by
defining
the
gnusource
macro
in
a
header
file
or
when
the
userland
code
is
being
compiled
system
calls
can
only
be
invoked
by
using
assembly
instructions
which
enable
the
transition
from
unprivileged
user
space
to
privileged
kernel
space
in
ring
for
this
reason
the
c
standard
library
libc
acts
as
a
wrapper
to
most
linux
system
calls
by
exposing
c
functions
that
only
whether
it
is
needed
can
transparently
enter
into
the
kernel
which
will
execute
on
behalf
of
the
calling
process
for
those
system
calls
not
exposed
by
libc
eg
the
fast
userspace
mutex
futex
the
library
provides
a
function
called
syscall
which
can
be
used
to
explicitly
invoke
them
pseudo
filesystems
eg
the
sysfs
and
procfs
filesystems
and
special
files
eg
devrandom
devsda
devtty
and
many
others
constitute
another

scheduling
the
linux
process
scheduler
is
modular
in
the
sense
that
it
enables
different
scheduling
classes
and
policies
scheduler
classes
are
plugable
scheduler
algorithms
that
can
be
registered
with
the
base
scheduler
code
each
class
schedules
different
types
of
processes
the
core
code
of
the
scheduler
iterates
over
each
class
in
order
of
priority
and
chooses
the
highest
priority
scheduler
that
has
a
schedulable
entity
of

linux
provides
both
user
preemption
as
well
as
full
kernel
preemption
preemption
reduces
latency
increases
responsiveness
and
makes
linux
more
suitable
for
desktop
and
realtime
applications
for
normal
tasks
by
default
the
kernel
uses
the
completely
fair
scheduler
cfs
class
introduced
in
the
version
of
the
kernel
internally
this
defaultscheduler
class
is
defined
in
a
macro
of
a
c
header
as
schednormal
in
other
posix
kernels
a
similar
policy
known
as
schedother
allocates
cpu
timeslices
ie
it
assigns
absolute
slices
of
the
processor
time
depending
on
either
predetermined
or
dynamically
computed
priority
of
each
process
the
linux
cfs
does
away
with
absolute
timeslices
and
assigns
a
fair
proportion
of
cpu
time
as
a
function
of
parameters
like
the
total
number
of
runnable
processes
and
the
time
they
have
already
run
this
function
also
takes
into
account
a
kind
of
weight
that
depends
on
their
relative
priorities
nice
values
with
user
preemption
the
kernel
scheduler
can
replace
the
current
process
with
the
execution
of
a
context
switch
to
a
different
one
that
therefore
acquires
the
computing
resources
for
running
cpu
memory
and
more
it
makes
it
according
to
the
cfs
algorithm
in
particular
it
uses
a
variable
called
vruntime
for
sorting
entities
and
then
chooses
the
one
that
has
the
smaller
vruntime
ie
the
schedulable
entity
that
has
had
the
least
share
of
cpu
time
to
the
active
scheduler
policy
and
to
the
relative
priorities
with
kernel
preemption
the
kernel
can
preempt
itself
when
an
interrupt
handler
returns
when
kernel
tasks
block
and
whenever
a
subsystem
explicitly
calls
the
schedule
function
the
kernel
also
contains
two
posixcompliant
realtime
scheduling
classes
named
schedfifo
realtime
firstinfirstout
and
schedrr
realtime
roundrobin
both
of
which
take

linux

by
a

most

are
built
on

almost
all

the

of
the

although
it
could
be
seen
as
a

is
divided
in
two
separate

this
split
in

is
due
to
the

and
to
the

needs
of

of
the

ie
it

in
the

there
is
no
memory
protection
no

unlike
in

therefore
memory

lead
to

linux
implements
virtual

this

numerous

linux
offers
a

of
mechanisms
to
reduce

responded
to
this
with
the
following
i
personally
consider

bugs
to
be
just
normal
bugs
i
dont
cover
them
up
but
i
also
dont
have
any
reason
whatsoever
to
think
its
a
good
idea
to
track
them
and
announce
them
as
something
specialone
reason
i
refuse
to
bother
with
the
whole
security
circus
is
that
i
think
it
glorifiesand
thus
encouragesthe
wrong
behavior
it
makes
heroes
out
of
security
people
as
if
the
people
who
dont
just
fix
normal
bugs
arent
as
important
in
fact
all
the
boring
normal
bugs
are
way
more
important
just
because
theressic
a
lot
more
of
them
i
dont
think
some
spectacular
security

should
be
glorified

cared
about
as
being
any
more

than
a

coding
style
in
september
the
gcc
version
requirement
for
compiling
and
building
the
linux

increased
from
gcc
to
allowing
the
potential
for
the
kernel
to
be
moved
from
using
c
code
based
on
the
c

to
using
code
written
with
the

with
the
migration
to
the
standard
taking
place
in
march
with
the
release
of
linux
initial
support
for
the
rust
programming
language
was
added
in
linux
which
was
released
in

with
later

such
as
linux
and
linux

gnu
toolchain
the
gnu
compiler
collection
gcc
or
gnu
cc
is
the
default
compiler
for
the
mainline
linux
sources
and
it
is
invoked
by
a
utility
called
make
then
the
gnu
assembler
more
often
called
gas
or
gnu
as
outputs
the
object
files
from
the
gcc
generated
assembly
code
finally
the
gnu
linker
gnu
ld
is
used
to
produce
a
statically
linked
executable
kernel
file
called
vmlinux
both
as
and
ld
are
part
of
gnu

binutils
the
abovementioned
tools
are
collectively
known
as

compiler
compatibility
gcc
was
for
a
long
time
the
only
compiler
capable
of
correctly
building
linux
in
intel
claimed
to
have
modified
the
kernel
so
that
its
c
compiler
was
also
capable
of
compiling
it
there
was
another
such
reported
success
in
with
a
modified
version
support
for
the
intel
compiler
has
been
dropped
in
since
effort
has
been
underway
to
build
linux
with
clang
an
alternative
compiler
for
the
c
language
as
of
april
the
official
kernel
could
almost
be
compiled
by
clang
the
project
dedicated
to
this
effort
is
named
llvmlinux
after
the
llvm
compiler
infrastructure
upon
which
clang
is
built
llvmlinux
does
not
aim
to
fork
either
linux
or
the
llvm
therefore
it
is
a
metaproject
composed
of
patches
that
are
eventually
submitted
to
the
upstream
projects
by
enabling
linux
to
be
compiled
by
clang
developers
may
benefit
from
shorter
compilation
times
in
developers
completed
upstreaming
patches
to
support
building
the

kernel
panic
and
linux
kernel
oops
an
example
of
linux
kernel
panic
bugs
involving
the
linux
kernel
can
be
difficult
to
troubleshoot
this
is
because
of
the
kernels
interaction
with
userspace
and
hardware
and
also
because
they
might
be
caused
from
a
wider
range
of
reasons
compared
to
those
of
user
programs
a
few
examples
of
the
underlying
causes
are
semantic
errors
in
code
misuse
of
synchronization
primitives
and
incorrect
hardware
management
a
report
of
a
nonfatal
bug
in
the
kernel
is
called
an
oops
such
deviations
from
correct
behavior
of
the
linux
kernel
may
allow
continued
operation
with
compromised
reliability
a
critical
and
fatal
error
is
reported
via
the
panic
function
it
prints
a
message
and
then
halts
the
kernel
one
of
the
most
common
techniques
used
to
find
out
bugs
in
code
is
debugging
by
printing
for
this
purpose
linux
provides
an
inkernel
api
called
printk
which
stores
messages
in
a
circular
buffer
the
syslog
system
call
is
used
for
reading
andor
clearing
the
kernel
message
ring
buffer
and
for
setting
the
maximum
log
level
of
the
messages
to
be
sent
to
the
console
ie
one
of
the
eight
kern
parameters
of
printk
which
tell
the
severity
of
the
condition
reported
usually
it
is
invoked
via
the
glibc
wrapper
klogctl
kernel
messages
are
also
exported
to
userland
through
the
devkmsg
interface
eg
systemdjournald
reads
that
interface
and
by
default
append
the
messages
to
varlogjournal
another
fundamental
technique
for
debugging
a
running
kernel
is
tracing
the
ftrace
mechanism
is
a
linux
internal
tracer
it
is
used
for
monitoring
and
debugging
linux
at
runtime
and
it
can
also
analyze
user
space
latencies
due
to
kernel
misbehavior
furthermore
ftrace
allows
users
to
trace
linux
at
boottime
kprobes
and
kretprobes
can
break
like
debuggers
in
userspace
into
linux
and
nondisruptively
collect
information
kprobes
can
be
inserted
into
code
at
almost
any
address
while
kretprobes
work
at
function
return
uprobes
have
similar
purposes
but
they
also
have
some
differences
in
usage
and
implementation
with
kgdb
linux
can
be
debugged
in
much
the
same
way
as
userspace
programs
kgdb
requires
an
additional
machine
that
runs
gdb
and
that
is
connected
to
the
target
to
be
debugged
using
a
serial
cable
or
ethernet
development
model
the
linux
kernel
project
integrates
new
code
on
a
rolling
basis
software
checked
into
the

must
work
and
compile
without
error
each
kernel
subsystem
is
assigned
a
maintainer
who
is
responsible
for
reviewing
patches
against
the
kernel
code
standards
and
keeps
a
queue
of
patches
that
can
be
submitted
to
linus
torvalds
within
a
merge
window
of
several
weeks
patches
are
merged
by
torvalds
into
the
source
code
of
the
prior
stable
linux
kernel
release
creating
the
rc
release
candidate
for
the
next
stable
kernel
once
the
merge
window
is
closed
only
fixes
to
the
new
code
in
the
development
release
are
accepted
the
rc
development
release
of
the
kernel
goes
through
regression
tests
and
once
it
is
judged
to
be
stable
by
torvalds
and
the
kernel
subsystem
maintainers
a
new
linux
kernel
is
released
and
the
development
process
starts
all
over
again
developers
who
feel
treated
unfairly
can
report
this
to
the
linux
foundations
technical
advisory
board
in
july
the
maintainer
of
the
usb
driver
sage
sharp
asked
torvalds
to
address
the
abusive
commentary
in
the
kernel
development
community
in
sharp
backed
out
of
linux
kernel
development
saying
that
the
focus
on
technical
excellence
in
combination
with
overloaded
maintainers
and
people
with
different
cultural
and
social
norms
means
that
linux
kernel
maintainers
are
often
blunt
rude
or
brutal
to
get
their
job
done
at
the
linuxconfau
lca
conference
in
developers
expressed
the
view
that
the
culture
of
the
community
has
gotten
much
better
in
the
past
few
years
daniel
vetter
the
maintainer
of
the
intel
drmi
graphics
kernel
driver
commented
that
the
rather
violent
language
and
discussion
in
the
kernel
community
has
decreased
or
disappeared
laurent
pinchart
asked
developers
for
feedback
on
their
experience
with
the
kernel
community
at
the
embedded
linux
conference
europe
the
issues
brought
up
were
discussed
a
few
days
later
at
the
maintainers
summit
concerns
over
the
lack
of
consistency
in
how
maintainers
responded
to
patches
submitted
by
developers
were
echoed
by
shuah
khan
the
maintainer
of
the
kernel
selftest
framework
torvalds
contended
that
there
would
never
be
consistency
in
the
handling
of
patches
because
different
kernel
subsystems
have
over
time
adopted
different
development
processes
therefore
it
was
agreed
upon
that
each
kernel
subsystem
maintainer
would
document
the
rules
for
patch
acceptance
mainline
linux
the
git
tree
of
linus
torvalds
that
contains
the
linux
kernel
is
referred
to
as
mainline
linux
every
stable
kernel
release
originates
from
the
mainline
tree
and
is
frequently
published
on
kernelorg
mainline
linux
has
only
solid
support
for
a
small
subset
of
the
many
devices
that
run
linux
nonmainline
support
is
provided
by
independent
projects
such
as
yocto
or
linaro
but
in
many
cases
the
kernel
from
the
device
vendor
is
needed
using
a
vendor
kernel
likely
requires
a
board
support
package
maintaining
a
kernel
tree
outside
of
mainline
linux
has
proven
to
be
difficult
mainlining
refers
to
the
effort
of
adding
support
for
a
device
to
the
mainline
kernel
while
there
was
formerly
only
support
in
a
fork
or
no
support
at
all
this
usually
includes
adding
drivers
or
device
tree
files
when
this
is
finished
the
feature
or
security
fix
is
considered
mainlined
linuxlike
kernel
the
maintainer
of
the
stable
branch
greg
kroahhartman
has
applied
the
term
linuxlike
to
downstream
kernel
forks
by
vendors
that
add
millions
of
lines
of
code
to
the
mainline
kernel
in
google
stated
that
they
wanted
to
use
the
mainline
linux
kernel
in
android
so
the
number
of
kernel
forks
would
be
reduced
the
term
linuxlike
has
also
been
applied
to
the
embeddable
linux
kernel
subset
which
does
not
include
the
full
mainline
linux
kernel
but
a
small
modified
subset
of
the
code
linux
forks
an
ipod
booting
ipodlinux
there
are
certain
communities
that
develop
kernels
based
on
the
official
linux
some
interesting
bits
of
code
from
these
forks
that
include
linuxlibre
compute
node
linux
ink
llinux
rtlinux
and
usermode
linux
uml
have
been
merged
into
the
mainline
some
operating
systems
developed
for
mobile
phones
initially
used
heavily
modified
versions
of
linux
including
google
android
firefox
os
hp
webos
nokia
maemo
and
jolla
sailfish
os
in
the
linux
community
criticised
google
for
effectively
starting
its
own
kernel
tree
this
means
that
any
drivers
written
for
android
hardware
platforms
can
not
get
merged
into
the
main
kernel
tree
because
they
have
dependencies
on
code
that
only
lives
in
googles
kernel
tree
causing
it
to
fail
to
build
in
the
kernelorg
tree
because
of
this
google
has
now
prevented
a
large
chunk
of
hardware
drivers
and
platform
code
from
ever
getting
merged
into
the
main
kernel
tree
effectively
creating
a
kernel
branch
that
a
number
of
different
vendors
are
now
relying
on
greg
kroahhartman
today
android
uses
a
customized
linux
where
major
changes
are
implemented
in
device
drivers
but
some
changes
to
the
core
kernel
code
is
required
android
developers
also
submit
patches
to
the
official
linux
that
finally
can
boot
the
android
operating
system
for
example
a
nexus
can
boot
and
run
the
mainline
linux
at
a
presentation
at
the
computer
history
museum
linus
torvalds
had
this
to
say
in
response
to
a
question
about
distributions
of
linux
using
precisely
the
same
kernel
sources
or
not
theyre
not
well
they
are
and
theyre
not
there
is
no
single
kernel
every
single
distribution
has
their
own
changes
thats
been
going
on
since
pretty
much
day
one
i
dont
know
if
you
may
remember
yggdrasil
was
known
for
having
quite
extreme
changes
to
the
kernel
and
even
today
all
of
the
major
vendors
have
their
own
tweaks
because
they
have
some
portion
of
the
market
theyre
interested
in
and
quite
frankly
thats
how
it
should
be
because
if
everybody
expects
one
person
me
to
be
able
to
track
everything
thats
not
the
point
of
gpl
thats
not
the
point
of
having
an
open
system
so
actually
the
fact
that
a
distribution
decides
that
something
is
so
important
to
them
that
they
will
add
patches
for
even
when
its
not
in
the
standard
kernel
thats
a
really
good
sign
for
me
so
thats
for
example
how
something
like
reiserfs
got
added
and
the
reason
why
reiserfs
is
the
first
journaling
filesystem
that
was
integrated
in
the
standard
kernel
was
not
because
i
love
hans
reiser
it
was
because
suse
actually
started
shipping
with
reiserfs
as
their
standard
kernel
which
told
me
ok
this
is
actually
in
production
use
normal
people
are
doing
this
they
must
know
something
i
dont
know
so
in
a
very
real
sense
what
a
lot
of
distribution
houses
do
they
are
part
of
this
lets
make
our
own
branch
and
lets
make
our
changes
to
this
and
because
of
the
gpl
i
can
take
the
best
portions
of
them

conflicts
there
have
been
several
notable
conflicts
among
linux

examples
of
such
conflicts
are
in
july
con
kolivas
announced
that
he
would
cease
developing
for

in
july
alan
cox
quit
his
role
as
the

maintainer
after
disagreement
with
linus

there
was
a

bottomley
and
scst
maintainer
vladislav
bolkhovitin
about
which
scsi
target
stack
should
be
included
in

this
made
some
linux
users
upset
in
june
torvalds
made
it
very
clear
that
he
did
not
agree
with
nvidia
releasing
its
drivers
as
closed
in
april
torvalds
banned
kay
sievers
from
submitting
patches
to
the
linux

for
failing
to
deal
with
bugs
that
caused
systemd
to
negatively
interact
with
the
kernel
in
october
lennart
poettering
accused
torvalds
of
tolerating
the
rough

and
of
being
a
bad
role
model
in
march
christoph
hellwig
filed
a
lawsuit
against
vmware
for
infringement
of
the
copyright
on
the

linus
torvalds

it
clear
that
he

and
similar
initiatives
by
calling

in
april
a

from
the

was
found
to
be
submitting
bad

patches
to

as
part
of
their
research
this
resulted
in
the
immediate
reversion
of
all
patches
ever
submitted
by
a
member
of

in
addition
a
warning
was
issued
by

that
any
future

would
be
rejected
on

prominent
linux

developers
have
been
aware
of
the
importance
of
avoiding
conflicts
between
developers
for
a
long
time
there
was
no

developers
due
to
opposition
by

torvalds
however
a

was
introduced
on

it
was
replaced
on

by

this
coincided
with
a

later
therefore
the
linux
kernel
maintainers
have
designated
some
stable
kernel
releases
as
longterm
these
longterm
support
linux
kernels
are
updated
with
bug
fixes
for
two
or
more
years
as
of
february
there
are
six
longterm
linux
kernels
and
the
full
list
of
releases
is
at
linux
kernel
version
history
relation
with
linux
distributions
most
linux
users
run
a
kernel
supplied
by
their
linux
distribution
some
distributions
ship
the
vanilla
or
stable
kernels
however
several
linux
distribution
vendors
such
as
red
hat
and
debian
maintain
another
set
of
linux
kernel
branches
which
are
integrated
into
their
products
these
are
usually
updated
at
a
slower
pace
compared
to
the
vanilla
branch
and
they
usually
include
all
fixes
from
the
relevant
stable
branch
but
at
the
same
time
they
can
also
add
support
for
drivers
or
features
which
had
not
been
released
in
the
vanilla
version
the
distribution
vendor
started
basing
their
branch
from
legal
aspects
licensing
terms
initially
torvalds
released
linux
under
a
license
which
forbade
any
commercial
use
this
was
changed
in
version
by
a
switch
to
the
gnu
general
public
license
version
gplv
this
license
allows
distribution
and
sale
of
possibly
modified
and
unmodified
versions
of
linux
but
requires
that
all
those
copies
be
released
under
the
same
license
and
be
accompanied
by
or
that
on
request
free
access
is
given
to
the
complete
corresponding
source
code
torvalds
has
described
licensing
linux
under
the
gplv
as
the
best
thing
i
ever
did
the
linux
kernel
is
licensed
explicitly
under
gnu
general
public
license
version
only
gplonly
with
an
explicit
syscall
exception
linuxsyscallnote
without
offering
the
licensee
the
option
to
choose
any
later
version
which
is
a
common
gpl
extension
contributed
code
must
be
available
under
gplcompatible
license
there
was
considerable
debate
about
how
easily
the
license
could
be
changed
to
use
later
gpl
versions
including
version
and
whether
this
change
is
even
desirable
torvalds
himself
specifically
indicated
upon
the
release
of
version
that
his
own
code
is
released
only
under
version
however
the
terms
of
the
gpl
state
that
if
no
version
is
specified
then
any
version
may
be
used
and
alan
cox
pointed
out
that
very
few
other
linux
contributors
had
specified
a
particular
version
of
the
gpl
in
september
a
survey
of
key
kernel
programmers
indicated
that
preferred
gplv
to
the
thencurrent
gplv
draft
torvalds
commented
i
think
a
number
of
outsiders
believed
that
i
personally
was
just
the
odd
man
out
because
ive
been
so
publicly
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
gplv
this
group
of
highprofile
kernel
developers
including
torvalds
greg
kroahhartman
and
andrew
morton
commented
on
mass
media
about
their
objections
to
the
gplv
they
referred
to
clauses
regarding
drmtivoization
patents
additional
restrictions
and
warned
a
balkanisation
of
the
open
source
universe
by
the
gplv
linus
torvalds
who
decided
not
to
adopt
the
gplv
for
the
linux
kernel
reiterated
his
criticism
even
years
later
loadable
kernel
modules
it
is
debated
whether
some
loadable
kernel
modules
lkms
are
to
be
considered
derivative
works
under
copyright
law
and
thereby
whether
or
not
they
fall
under
the
terms
of
the
gpl
in
accordance
with
the
license
rules
lkms
using
only
a
public
subset
of
the
kernel
interfaces
are
nonderived
works
thus
linux
gives
system
administrators
the
mechanisms
to
load
outoftree
binary
objects
into
the
kernel
address
space
there
are
some
outoftree
loadable
modules
that
make
legitimate
use
of
the
dmabuf
kernel
feature
gpl
compliant
code
can
certainly
use
it
however
a
different
possible
use
case
would
be
nvidia
optimus
that
pairs
a
fast
gpu
with
an
intel
integrated
gpu
where
the
nvidia
gpu
writes
into
the
intel
framebuffer
when
it
is
active
but
nvidia
cannot
use
this
infrastructure
because
it
necessitates
bypassing
a
rule
that
can
only
be
used
by
lkms
that
are
also
gpl
alan
cox
replied
on
lkml
rejecting
a
request
from
one
of
their
engineers
to
remove
this
technical
enforcement
from
the
api
torvalds
clearly
stated
on
the
lkml
that
i
claim
that
binaryonly
kernel
modules
are
derivative
by
default
on
the
other
hand
torvalds
has
also
said
that
one
gray
area
in
particular
is
something
like
a
driver
that
was
originally
written
for
another
operating
system
ie
clearly
not
a
derived
work
of
linux
in
origin
that
is
a
gray
area
and
that
is
the
area
where
i
personally
believe
that
some
modules
may
be
considered
to
not
be
derived
works
simply
because
they
werent
designed
for
linux
and
dont
depend
on
any
special
linux
behaviour
proprietary
graphics
drivers
in
particular
are
heavily
discussed
whenever
proprietary
modules
are
loaded
into
linux
the
kernel
marks
itself
as
being
tainted
and
therefore
bug
reports
from
tainted
kernels
will
often
be
ignored
by
developers
firmware
binary
blobs
the
official
kernel
that
is
the
linus
git
branch
at
the
kernelorg
repository
contains
binary
blobs
released
under
the
terms
of
the
gnu
gplv
license
linux
can
also
search
filesystems
to
locate
binary
blobs
proprietary
firmware
drivers
or
other
executable
modules
then
it
can
load
and
link
them
into
kernel
space
when
it
is
needed
eg
for
accessing
boot
devices
or
for
speed
firmware
can
be
builtin
to
the
kernel
this
means
building
the
firmware
into
vmlinux
however
this
is
not
always
a
viable
option
for
technical
or
legal
issues
eg
it
is
not
permitted
to
do
this
with
firmware
that
is
nongpl
compatible
although
this
is
quite
common
nonetheless
trademark
linux
is
a
registered
trademark
of
linus
torvalds
in
the
united
states
the
european
union
and
some
other
countries
a
legal
battle
over
the
trademark
began
in
when
william
della
croce
a
lawyer
who
was
never
involved
in
the
development
of
linux
started
requesting
licensing
fees
for
the
use
of
the
word
linux
after
it
was
proven
that
the
word
was
in
common
use
long
before
della
croces
claimed

was
awarded

a
price
panned
by

due

struggle
between

do
you
want
to
sell
sugar
water
for
the
rest
of
your
life
or
come
with
me
and
change
the
world
sculley
removed
jobs
as
the
head
of
the
macintosh
division
with
unanimous
support
from
the
apple
board
of
directors
the
board
of

instructed
sculley
to
contain

his
ability
to
launch
expensive
forays
into
untested

rather
than
submit
to
sculleys
direction

attempted
to
oust
him
from

jeanlouis
gasse
informed
sculley
that
jobs
had
been
attempting
to
organize
a
boardroom
coup
and
called
an
emergency
meeting
at
which
apples
executive
staff
sided
with
sculley
and
stripped
jobs
of
all
operational
duties
jobs
resigned
from

in

and
took
several
apple
employees
with
him
to
found
next
wozniak
had
also
quit
his
active
employment
at
apple
earlier
in
to
pursue
other
ventures
expressing
his
frustration
with
apples
treatment
of
the
apple
ii
division
and
stating
that
the

had
been
going
in
the
wrong
direction
for

remained
apple
shareholders
following

wozniak
in

launched

that
year

pagemaker
an
early
desktop
publishing
application
taking
advantage
of
the
postscript
language
was
also
released
by
aldus
corporation
in
july
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
combination
of
macintosh
laserwriter
and
pagemaker
was
responsible
for
the
creation
of
the
desktop
publishing
market
this
dominant
position
in
the
desktop
publishing
market
allowed
the
company
to
focus
on
higher
price
points
the
socalled
highright
policy
named
for
the
position
on
a
chart
of
price
vs
profits
newer
models
selling
at
higher
price
points
offered
higher
profit
margin
and
appeared
to
have
no
effect
on
total
sales
as
power
users
snapped
up
every
increase
in
speed
although
some
worried
about
pricing
themselves
out
of
the
market
the
highright
policy
was
in
full
force
by
the
mids
due
to
jeanlouis
gasses
slogan
of
fiftyfive
or
die
referring
to
the
profit
margins
of
the
macintosh
ii
this
policy
began
to
backfire
late
in
the
decade
as
desktop
publishing
programs
appeared
on
ibm
pc
compatibles
with
some
of
the
same
functionality
of
the
macintosh
at
far
lower
price
points
the
company
lost
its
dominant
position
in
the
desktop
publishing
market
and
estranged
many
of
its
original
consumer
customer
base
who
could
no
longer
afford
apple
products
the
christmas
season
of
was
the
first
in
the
companys
history
to
have
declining
sales
which
led
to
a
drop
in
apples
stock
price
during
this
period
the
relationship
between
sculley
and
gasse
deteriorated
leading
sculley
to
effectively
demote
gasse
in
january
by
appointing
michael
spindler
as
the
chief
operating
officer
gasse
left
the
company
later
that
year
decline
and
restructuring
the
company
pivoted
strategy
and
in
october
introduced
three
lowercost
models
the
macintosh
classic
the
macintosh
lc
and
the
macintosh
iisi
all
of
which
saw
significant
sales
due
to
pentup
demand
in
apple
introduced
the
hugely
successful
powerbook
with
a
design
that
set
the
current
shape
for
almost
all
modern
laptops
the
same
year
apple
introduced
system
a
major
upgrade
to
the
macintosh
operating
system
adding
color
to
the
interface
and
introducing
new
networking
capabilities
the
success
of
the
lowercost
macs
and
powerbook
brought
increasing
revenue
for
some
time
apple
was
doing
very
well
introducing
fresh
new
products
at
increasing
profits
the
magazine
macaddict
named
the
period
between
and
as
the
first
golden
age
of
the
macintosh
the
penlite
is
apples
first
tablet
computer
prototype
created
in
to
bring
the
mac

to
a

it
was
canceled
in
favor
of
the
newton
the
success
of
lowercost
consumer
macs
especially
the
lc
cannibalized
higherpriced
machines
to
address
this
management
introduced
several
new
brands
selling
largely
identical
machines
at
different
price
points
for
different
markets
the
highend
quadra
series
the
midrange
centris
series
and
the
consumermarketed
performa
series
this
led
to
significant
consumer
confusion
between
so
many
models
in
the
early
s
the
apple
ii
series
was
discontinued
it
was
expensive
to
produce
and
the
company
decided
it
was
still
absorbing
sales
from
lowercost
macintosh
models
after
the
launch
of
the
lc
apple
encouraged
developers
to
create
applications
for
macintosh
rather
than
apple
ii
and
authorized
salespersons
to
redirect
consumers
from
apple
ii
and
toward
macintosh
the
apple
iie
was
discontinued
in
apple
experimented
with
several
other
unsuccessful
consumer
targeted
products
during
the
s
including
quicktake
digital
cameras
powercd
portable
cd
audio
players
speakers
the
pippin
video
game
console
the
eworld
online
service
and
apple
interactive
television
box
enormous
resources
were
invested
in
the
problematic
newton
tablet
division
based
on
john
sculleys
unrealistic
market
forecasts
throughout
this
period
microsoft
continued
to
gain
market
share
with
windows
by
focusing
on
delivering
software
to
inexpensive
personal
computers
while
apple
was
delivering
a
richly
engineered
but
expensive
experience
apple
relied
on
high
profit
margins
and
never
developed
a
clear
response
it
sued
microsoft
for
making
a
gui
similar
to
the
lisa
in
apple
computer
inc
v
microsoft
corp
the
lawsuit
dragged
on
for
years
and
was
finally
dismissed
the
major
product
flops
and
the
rapid
loss
of
market
share
to
windows
sullied

reputation
and
in
sculley
was
replaced
as

to
create
a
new
computing
platform
the
powerpc
reference
platform
or
prep
with
ibm
and
motorola
hardware
coupled
with
apple
software
the
aim
alliance
hoped
that
preps
performance
and
apples
software
would
leave
the
pc
far
behind
and
thus
counter
the
dominance
of
windows
that
year
apple
introduced
the
power
macintosh
the
first
of
many
computers
with
motorolas
powerpc
processor
in
the
wake
of
the
alliance
apple
opened
up
to
the
idea
of
allowing
motorola
and
other
companies
to
build
macintosh
clones
over
the
next
two
years
distinct
macintosh
clone
models
were
introduced
however
by
apple
executives
were
worried
that
the
clones
were
cannibalizing
sales
of
its
own
highend
computers
where
profit
margins
were
highest
in
spindler
was
replaced
by
gil
amelio
as
ceo
who
was
hired
for
his
reputation
as
a
corporate
rehabilitator
amelio
made
deep
changes
including
extensive
layoffs
and
costcutting
this
period
was
also
marked
by
numerous
failed
attempts
to
modernize
the
macintosh
operating
system
macos
the
original
macintosh
operating
system
system
was
not
built
for
multitasking
running
several
applications
at
once
the
company
attempted
to
correct
this
by
introducing
cooperative
multitasking
in
system
but
still
decided
it
needed
a
more
modern
approach
this
led
to
the
pink
project
in
aux
that
year
copland
in
and
evaluated
the
purchase
of
beos
in
talks
with

stalled
when
the
ceo
former
apple

jeanlouis

demanded

instead
of
apples
million

only
weeks
away
from

apples
board
preferred
nextstep
and
purchased

in
late
for

retained
steve

was
finalized
on

and
the

brought

back
to
apple
as

on
july

staged
a
boardroom
coup
that
resulted
in
amelios
resignation
after
overseeing
a
threeyear
recordlow

and
crippling
financial
losses
the
board
named

he
immediately
reviewed

august
steve
jobs
convinced
microsoft
to
make
a
million
investment
in
apple
and
a
commitment
to
continue
developing
mac
software
this
was
seen
as
an
antitrust
insurance
policy
for
microsoft
which
had
recently
settled
with
the
department
of
justice
over
anticompetitive
practices
in
the
united

the
lawsuits
came
after

privacy
prism
is
a
clandestine
surveillance
program
under
which
the
nsa
collects
user
data
from
companies
like
facebook
and
apple
apple
has
publicly
taken
a
proprivacy
stance
actively
making
privacyconscious
features
and
settings
part
of
its
conferences
promotional
campaigns
and
public
image
with
its
ios
mobile
operating
system
in
the
company
started
encrypting
all
contents
of
ios
devices
through
users
passcodes
making
it
impossible
at
the
time
for
the
company
to
provide
customer
data
to
law
enforcement
requests
seeking
such
information
with
the
popularity
rise
of
cloud
storage
solutions
apple
began
a
technique
in
to
do
deep
learning
scans
for
facial
data
in
photos
on
the
users
local
device
and
encrypting
the
content
before
uploading
it
to
apples
icloud
storage
system
it
also
introduced
differential
privacy
a
way
to
collect
crowdsourced
data
from
many
users
while
keeping
individual
users
anonymous
in
a
system
that
wired
described
as
trying
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
about
a
group
while
learning
as
little
as
possible
about
any
individual
in
it
users
are
explicitly
asked
if
they
want
to
participate
and
can
actively
optin
or
optout
however
apple
has
aided
law
enforcement
in
criminal
investigations
by
providing
icloud
backups
of
users
devices
and
the
companys
commitment
to
privacy
has
been
questioned
by
its
efforts
to
promote
biometric
authentication
technology
in
its
newer
iphone
models
which
do
not
have
the
same
level
of
constitutional
privacy
as
a
passcode
in
the
united

with
apples
release
of
an
update
to
ios
apple
required
all
developers
of
iphone
ipad
and
ipod
touch
applications
to
directly
ask
iphone
users
permission
to
track
them
the
feature
called
app
tracking
transparency
received
heavy
criticism
from
facebook
whose
primary
business
model
revolves
around
the
tracking
of
users
data
and
sharing
such
data
with
advertisers
so
users
can
see
more
relevant
ads
a
technique
commonly
known
as
targeted
advertising
after
facebooks
measures
including
purchasing
fullpage
newspaper
advertisements
protesting
app

apple
released
the
update
in

a

be
compared
to
a

provided
by

if
enough

were
found
apple
would
be
alerted
and
authorities
informed
the
new
features
received
praise
from
law

and
victims
rights
advocates
however
privacy
advocates
including
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
condemned
the
new
features
as
invasive
and
highly
prone
to
abuse
by
authoritarian
governments
irelands
data
protection
commission
launched
a
privacy
investigation
to
examine
whether
apple
complied
with
the
eus
gdpr
law
following
an
investigation
into
how
the
company
processes
personal
data
with
targeted
ads
on
its
platform
in
december
security
researcher
brian
krebs
discovered
that
the
iphone
pro
would
still
show
the
arrow
indicator
signifying
location
services
are
being
used
at
the
top
of
the
screen
while
the
main
location
services
toggle
is
enabled
despite
all
individual
location
services
being
disabled
krebs
was
unable
to
replicate
this
behavior
on
older
models
and
when
asking
apple
for
comment
he
was
told
by
apple
that
it
is
expected
behavior
that
the
location
services
icon
appears
in
the
status
bar
when
location
services
is
enabled
the
icon
appears
for
system
services
that
do
not
have
a
switch
in
settings
apple
later
further
clarified
that
this
behavior
was
to
ensure
compliance
with
ultrawideband
regulations
in
specific
countries
a
technology
apple
started
implementing
in
iphones
starting
with
iphone
pro
and
emphasized
that
the
management
of
ultra
wideband
compliance
and
its
use
of
location
data
is
done
entirely
on
the
device
and
apple
is
not
collecting
user
location
data
will
strafach
an
executive
at
security
firm
guardian
firewall
confirmed
the
lack
of
evidence
that
location
data
was
sent
off
to
a
remote
server
apple
promised
to
add
a
new
toggle
for
this
feature
and
in
later
ios
revisions
apple
provided
users
with
the
option
to

informal
culture
had
become
a
key
trait
that
differentiated
it
from

according
to
a
report
in

this
has
resulted
in
a
corporate
culture
more
akin
to
a

rather
than
a
multinational

in
a

wozniak
credited
watching

as
inspiration
for
cofounding

the

grown
and
been
led
by
a
series
of
differently
opinionated
chief

it
has
arguably
lost

the

this
increased

the

asml
released
the

arizona
in

in

announced

fab
in

arizona
intended
to
begin
production
by
at
a
rate
of
wafers
per

as
of
tsmc
announced
that
it
would
bring
its
newest
nm
process
to
the
arizona
facility
a
significant
break
from
its
prior
practice
of
limiting
us
fabs
to
older
technologies
the
arizona
plant
was
estimated
to
not
be
fully
operational
until
when
the
nm
process
is
projected
to
be
replaced
by
tsmcs
nm
process
as
the
latest
technology
at
launch
it
will
be
the
most
advanced
fab
in

united

tsmc
plans
to
spend
billion
on
the
project
over
eight
years
beginning
in
tsmc
claimed
the
plant
will
create
fulltime
jobs
in
december
tsmc
announced
its
plans
to
triple
its
investment
in
the
arizona
plants
in
response
to
the
growing
tensions
between
the
us
and
china
and
the
supply
chain
disruption
that
has
led
to
chip
shortages
in
that
same
month
tsmc
stated
that
they
were
running
into
major
cost
issues
because
the
cost
of
construction
of
buildings
and
facilities
in
the
us
is
four
to
five
times
what
an
identical
plant
would
cost
in
taiwan
due
to
higher
costs
of
labor
red
tape
and
training
as
well
as
difficulty
finding
qualified
personnel
for
which
it
has
hired
us
workers
and
sent
them
for
training
in
taiwan
for
months
these
additional
production
costs
will
increase
the
cost
of
tsmcs
chips
made
in
the
us
to
at
least
more
than
the
cost
of
chips
made
in
taiwan
in
july
tsmc
warned
that
us
talent
was
insufficient
so
taiwanese
workers
will
need
to
be
brought
in
for
a
limited
time
and
that
the
chip
factory
wont
be
operational
until
in
september
an
analyst
said
the
chips
will
still
need
to
be
sent
back
to
taiwan
for
packaging
in
january
tsmc
chairman
liu
again
warned
that
arizona
lacked
workers
with
the
specialized
skills
to
hire
and
that
tsmcs
second
arizona
plant
likely
wont
start
volume
production
of
advanced
chips
until

in

the
us
commerce
department
agreed

in
direct
funding
and
up

purposes

between

by
no

universally
observed
especially
when
either
is
used
without
special
reference
to
the

but
when
a
distinction
is
present
to
the
mind
authentic
implies
that
the
con
tents
of
a
book
picture
account
or
the
like
correspond
to
facts
and
are
not
fictitious

the
artificial
character
of

fact
that

authoress
is
a
word
that
has
always
been
disliked
by
authoresses
them
selves
perhaps
on
the
ground
that
sex
is
irrelevant
to
art
and
that
the
word
implies
disparagement
of
womens
literary
abilities
they
had
good
reason
to
be
sensitive
as
recently
as
a
savoy
audience
was
invited
to
applaud
the
sentiment
that
that
singular
anomaly
the
lady
novelist
never
would
be
missed
when
the

was

the
authoresses
seemed
to
be
getting
their
way
for
the
opinion
is
there
given
that
authoress
is
now
only
used
when
sex
is
purposely
emphasized
otherwise
in
all
the
senses
and
especially
the
last
se
a
female
literary
composer
author
is
now
used
of
both
sexes
but
authoress
is
dying
hard
seventy
years
after
the
oeds
pronouncement
a
book
re

still
finds
it
natural
to
say
the

does
not
much
discuss

quality
of

see
everything

all
that

by

and
had

archaic
or
obsolete
the
supp

not

this
verdict
but
the

since

no

avantgarde
has

however
that

beginning

than

vanguard
music
is
the
descrip
tion
applied
by
a
music
critic

avenge
revenge
vengeance
avenge
and
vengeance
are
one
pair
revenge
verb
and
noun
another
the
distinction
between
the
two
pairs
is
neither
very
clear
nor
consistently
ob
served
this
is
natural
since
the
same
act
done
under
the
same
conditions
may
be
described
either
as
vengeance
or
as
revenge
according
to
the
point
of
view
from
which
it
is
regarded
it
may
averse
be
said
roughly
that
vengeance
is
redressing
the
balance
by
an
offenders
being
made
to
suffer
something
more
or
less
equivalent
to
his
offence
while
revenge
is
the
satisfying
of
the
offended
partys
resentment
by
the
same
means
one
act
may
effect
both
but
it
will
be
spoken
of
by
one
name
or
the
other
according
to
context
it
is
in
harmony
with
this
that
the
subject
of
the
active
verb
revenge
is
ordinarily
the
wronged
party
and
its
object
either
himself
or
a
wrong
done
at
least
indirectly
to
him
while
the
subject
of
avenge
is
ordinarily
a
disinterested
party
and
its
object
another
person
or
a
wrong
done
to
another
exceptions
are
numerous
but
choice
may
be
assisted
by
remembering
the
general
principle
that
personal
feeling
is
the
thing
thought
of
when
revenge
is
used
and
the
equalization
of
wrongs
when
avenge
or
vengeance
is
used
averse
aversion

did
not

the
writers
of

dative
after

if
it
had
need

to
whom
the
original
and
physical
sense
is
not
usually
present

after

the
preposition
that
best
fits
their
true
sense
avocation
originally
a
calling
away
an
interruption
a
distraction
is
used
in
britain
though
not
in
us
as
a
stylish
synonym
for
vocation
or
calling
with
which
it
is
properly
in
antithesis
this
has
destroyed
a
useful
differentiation

vocation
has
re
tained
the
idea
of
a
calling
a
man
is
fortunate
if
his
avocation
in
the
sense

his
occupation
is

a

as
lazy
banting
of
the
nonexistent
word
laze
bant
from
which
it
might
have
come
it
is
natural
to
guess
that
the
words
scaven
ger
salvage
and
gridiron
are
formed
from
verbs
scavenge
and
salve
and
a
noun
grid
and
consequently
to
use
those
verbs
and
noun
if
occasion
arises
those
who
first
used
them
however
were
mistaken
and
were
themselves
making
the
words
out
of
what
they
wrongly
took
for
their
derivatives
similarly
banting
is
not
formed
from
bant
but
is
the
name
first
of
a
man
and
then
of
his
system
out
of
which
the
verb
to
bant
was
made
by

perhaps
sufficiently
explain

an

barbarian

it

barbaric
is

with

indifference

admira

and
means
of
the
simple

that

we
speak
of

simpli
city
strength

barbarous
on
the
other
hand
always
implies
at

contempt
and
often
moral
condemnation
it
means
that
is

all
the

that
the

from
its

in

bulletins
has
become
popular
instead
of

literary
en
verbs
from
adjectives
it
being
no
part
of
most
peoples
business
to
inquire
into
such
matters
the
average
writer
would
probably
say
if
asked
for
an
offhand
opinion
that
from
any
ad
jective
of
one
syllable
an
en
verb
could
be
formed
meaning
to

at

roughly
the
position
taken
up
by
one
party
to
a
newspaper
controversy
some

on
the
merits
of
quieten
a
very
slight
examination
shows
it
to
be
remote
from
the
facts
en
cannot
be
called
a
living
suffix
there
are
on
the
one
hand
some
en
verbs
whose
cur
rency
is
beyond
question
on
the
other
hand
as
many
adjectives
may
be
found
that
though
they
look
as
fit
as
the
for
turning
into
verbs
by
addition
of
en
verbs
from
adjectives
en
no
one
would
dream
of
treating
in
that
way
some
of
them
are
allowed
to
become
verbs
without
the
en
lame
wet
blind
foul
others
have
to
go
without
a

grand

others
have

large

and
explain

and
the
despotism
of

is
still
clearer

are

about

may

the

to

its

the

of

the

now
shown

perhaps
attributable
not
so
much
to
a

used
by
the
un

who
guess
at
its

it
is
a
legitimate
enough
phrase
in

meant
for
the
edu
cated
only
but
hardly
so
in

newspaper
where
it
is
certain
not
to
be
understood
by
most

where
it
therefore
tends
to
be

by
slipshod
extension
the
false

to

that
false

vulgar

of
which

it
in

four

because

ing
seems
plainer
though

so
in

there
are
the
idols

the
fallacies
of

those
a

owing

as
enclosed

due

the
unstable
relation

fluctuate
as

due

who
would
guess
all
that
unaided
who
on

would
not
guess
that
an
idol
of
the
marketplace
was
just
any
belief
to
which
the
man
in

street
yields
a
mistaken
deference
the
odd
thing
is
that
no
better
instance
could
be
found
of
an
idol
of
the
market
than
the
phrase
itself
oscillating
between
its
real
mean
ing
and
the
modern
misuse
so
that
the
very
person
who
pours
scorn
on

often

in
the
very
act

ridiculing

the
mistake
is
com
mon
enough
but
is
not
easily
exhibited
except
in
passages
of
some
length
so
that
one
must
here
suffice
the
ten
dency
to
exalt
the
man
of
action
above
the
man
of
theory
may
be
illadvised

it
has
nothing
to
do
with

acceptations

the

a
place
very
secondary
by
comparison
it
is
not
easy
to
account
for
this
common
estimate
for
one
thing
as
soon
as
inquiry
is
made
into
it

common

it
seems
worth
while
to
quote
some
examples
bracketing
in

either
if

or
and
when
and
asking
whether
the
omission
would
in
any
way
change
the
meaning
or
diminish
the
force
of
the
sentence
the
radicals
do
not
know
quite
clearly
what
they
will
be
at

when
the
fight
is
renewed
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
labour
party
if
and
when
they
come
to
power
will
be
courageous
enough
to
free
the
ether
from
the
bondage
of
commercialism

if

dered
it
will
be

arranged

terminate

day

mr

de

about
how
britain
might
dispose
of
its
nuclear
armoury
if
and
when
it
joins
the
common
market
they
must
of
course
be
certain
that
they
are
getting
what
they
are
bargainingfor

if
and
when
they
have
made
sure
of
that
they
would
be
wisely
advised
to
pay
the
price
it
was
admitted
above
that
cases
were
conceivable
in
which
the
if
and
the
when
might
be
genuinely
and
separately
significant
such
cases
arise
when
one
desires
to
say
that
the
result
will
or
does
or
did
not
only
follow
but
follow
without
delay
they
are
not
in

rare
and
if
a
really
good
writer
allows
himself
an
if
and
when
one
such
must
have
presented
itself
but
in
practice
he
hardly
ever
does
it
even
then
because
any
strong
emphasis
on
the
absence
of

is
much
better
given
by
other
means
by
the
insertion
of
at

some
equivalent
in

clause
so
true
is
this
that
when
the
devotees
of
if

have
had
the
luck
to
strike
a
real
opportunity
for
their
favourite
they
cannot
refrain
from
inserting
some
adverb
to
do
over
again
the
work
that
was
the
only
true
function
of
their
and
when
in

fol

these
adverbs
that

type
the
electors
knew
perfectly

these

illegal
is
the
most
pre
cise
with
its
meaning
of
contrary
to
the
law
of
the
land
the
scope
of
illegitimate
is
wider
it
includes
not
only
what
is
not
authorized
by
law
but
also
what
is
against
propriety
or
reason
and
its
possible
application
ranges
from
a
child
born
out
of
wed
lock
to
a
deduction
not
justified
by
premises
illicit
also
covers
what
is
impermissible
though
not
necessarily
illegal
including
logical
fallacies
in
its
sense
of
contrary
to
law
it
is
applied
especially
to
activities
that
the
law
allows
only
subject
to
compliance
with
certain
conditions
eg
gambling
and
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
alcoholic
drinks
this
meaning
goes
naturally
with
its
derivation
from
lat
licere
permit
unlawful
with
its
sweeping
implication
of
comprising
what
is
for
bidden

only
by
the

that
narrows

of

has
an
effect

in

case
it
would
have
been
worthwhile

since
without

the

weakens
the
force
without

for

and
to
regard
the
now

archaic

in

as
an

there
are
no

special

keeping
it

even
in

natural

in

to
a

degree
where
lower
is

the
general
tendency
is
unmistakable
and
since
it
makes
for
precision
is
one
that
should
be
complied
with

the
original
and

use
of
this

is
to
append
it

nouns
so
producing
adjectives

have
an
undeniable
advantage
in

short
ness
compare
resistless
and
fadeless
with
irresistible
and
unfadable
but
this
is
outweighed
for
all
except
fully
established
ones
by
the
uneasy
feeling
that
there
is
something
queer
about
them

purposes
it
will
seem
of
some
importance
that
it
should
not
become
necessary
with
every
word
in
which
less

what
can

a

we
ought
to
be

assume
that
with
a

wellknown

less
words
mean
simply
without
what

the

libel
and
slander
the
much
quoted
saying
the
greater
the
truth
the
greater
or
worse
the
libel
makes
us
all
occasionally
curious
about
what
a
is
and
how
it
differs
from
a
slander
in
popular
usage
they
are
synonymous
meaning
a
deliberate
untrue
derogatory
statement
usually
about
a
person
whether
made
in
writing
or
orally
in
legal
usage
there
liberal
are
important
differences
each
is
an
untrue
and
defamatory
imputation
made
by
one
person
about
another
which
if
published
ie
commu
nicated
to
a
third
person
can
be
a
ground
for
a
civil
action
for
damages
such
an
imputation
is
a
libel
if
made
in
permanent
form
writing
pictures
etc
or
by
broadcasting
it
is
a
slander
if
made
in
fugitive
form
eg
by
speak
ing
or
gestures
a
further
distinction
is
that
an
action
for
slander
cannot
ordinarily
succeed
without
proof
that
actual
damage
has
been
caused
in
an
action
for
libel
this
is
unnecessary
in
both
cases
proof
that
the
allegation
was
true
is
a
good
defence
deliberate
defamation
of
a
person
in
permanent
form
can
also
be
treated
as
a
crime
criminal
i
on
the
ground
that
it
tends
to
provoke
a
breach
of
the
peace
a
criminal
differs
from
a
civil
in
that
publication
to
a
third
person
is
not
a
necessary
element
in
it
and
proof
of
its
truth
is
not
in
itself
a
good
defence
this
explains
the
seeming
paradox
in
the
saying
attributed
to
lord
mansfield
quoted
above
since
truth
may
be
pleaded
in
defence
but
only
if
the
accused
can
show
also
that
he
acted
in
the
public
interest

most

popular
synonyms
of
libel
and

are
now
being

under
the

liberal

the
adjective
retains
a
sense
that
is
almost
obsolete
and
yet
is
near
enough
to
some
extant
senses
to
make

possible
a

neither

them

in

this

is

for
those
who
decide
against
the

use
that
has
been
already
discussed
and
wish
to
avoid
also
some
similar
questionable
uses
of
a
less
easily
recognizable
kind
all
the
examples
in
i
were
of
the
undisguised
conjunctional
use
and
contained
a
subordinate
clause
with
its
verb
most
of
those
now
to
come
have
no
sub
ordinate
verb
and
in
all
of
them
may
be
regarded
as
an
adjective
or
adverb
having
the
additional
power
cf
worth
of
directly
governing
nouns
as
if
it
were
a
preposition
the
first
type
is
perhaps
not
really
different
from
that
discussed
in
i
like
examples
are
these
lovely

the
peculiarity
of
these
is
that
in
each
there
is
a
previous
noun
or
pronoun
shores
county
he
with
which
may
agree
as
an
adjective
and
an
ellipsis
of
those
or
what
may
be
supposed
such
a
defence
is
neither
plausible
nor
satisfactory
and
the
sentences
are
no
better
than
others
containing
a
verb
of
sentences
in
which
is
not
fol
lowed
by
a
verb
certain
forms
are
unexceptionable
but
are
liable
to
ex
tensions
that
are
not
so
the
un
questioned
forms
are
he
talks
i
an
expert
and
you
are
treating
me
i
a
fool
in
which
is
equivalent
to
a
preposi
tional
adverb
similarly
to
and
you
i
me
are
disappointed
in
which
is
equivalent
either
to
an
adverb
as
before
or
perhaps
rather
to
a
pre
positional
adjective
resembling
in
this
respect
the
second
third
and
fourth
types
are
faulty
and
represent
neglect
of
various
limitations
observed
in
the
correct
forms
second
type
the
committee

following

j
the

their

it
is

that

rare
we
may
have
no
like
last
year
when
paignton
and
jersey
all
enjoyed
a
sunbath
of
nearly
hours
the
limitation
here
disregarded
is
that
the
word
governed
by
must
be
a
noun
not
an
adverb
or
an
adverbial
phrase
yesterday
and
last
year
are
not
nouns
but
an
adverb
and
an
adverbial
phrase
and
kowet
and
the
closing
years
meaning
at
koweit
and
in
the
closing
years
have
also
only
a
deceitful
ap
pearance
of
being
nouns
third
type
people
get
alarmed
on
each
occasion
on
which
the
present
case
dying
children
suddenly
appear
like
he
has
completed
a
new
work
in
which
its
authors
recent
books
no
failing
in
sparkle
or
vigour
will
be
traceable
and
then
came
the
war
many
an
other
english
village
it
filtered
slowly
very
slowly
through
to
his
the
limitation
suggested
with
diffidence
that
has
here
been
disregarded
is
that
the
preceding
noun
to
which
is
attached
must
be
not
one
governed
by
a
preposition
but
subject
or
object
of
the
main
verb
the
preceding
nouns
are
which
ie
occasion
which
ie
work
and
his
ie
village
governed
by
on
in
and
to
instead
of
read
as
in
the
present
case
as
in
its
authors
recent
books
and
as
to
many
another
fourth
type
l
his
roman
prede
cessor
his
private
life
was
profligate
i
antony
he
was
an
insatiate
gambler
although
his
colleague
his
conduct
had
not
been
above
reproach
the
limitation
is
that
the
word
governed
by
must
be
in
pari
materia
with
the
one
to
which
it
is
compared
the
pre
decessor
and
his
colleague
are
not
so
related
to
his
life
and
his
conduct
but
antony
is
to
he
and
that
sentence
alone
will
pass
muster
this
mistake
however
of
comparing
unlike
things
though
the
commonest
type
of
misuse
of
by
educated
writers
is
not
pecu
liar
to
but
is
a
slovenly
parsimony
of
words
that
may
occur
in
many
other
constructions
it
is
perhaps
even
commoner
with
unlike
than
unlike
great
britain
the
upper

a
warning
should
however
be
added
against
going
too
far
in
anxiety
to
avoid
all
questionable
uses
of
a
fashion
seems
to
be
growing
even
among
some
good
writers
to
prefer
as
to
not
only
rightly
as
a
conjunction
but
also
iadvisedly
as
a
preposi
tional
adjective

may
read
like

if
these

it
is
clear
that

both
as

as
an

in

is
indeed
no

the

the

of

for

of

that

do

us
it
is
now
sometimes
used
for
pseudonyms

those
adopted

most

they
may
do

a

can
hardly

that

looked
up

of
some
longer
and
more
imposing
word
some
non

we

adequately
grandiose
vocable
that
nomenclature
does
not
mean
a
name
but
a
system
of
naming

of

is
to
such
writers
what
they
would
perhaps
call
a
mere
meticu
losity
see
love
of
the
long
word
the
forerunner
of
the
present
luxurious
establishment
was
the
wellknown
glou
cester
coffee
house
the
nomenclature
of
which
was
derived
from
that
duke
of
gloucester
who
a
small
com
mittee
of
city
men
has
just
launched
a
society
under
the
nomenclature
of
thelleague
of
interpreters
with
the
object
of
the
most
important
race
of
the
season
for
threeyearold
fillies
the
nomenclature
was
obtained
from
lord
derbys

in
the
little
hamlet
of
nominal

this
as
the
adjective

the
grammatical

the

eg
in
partly
elective

is
often
and
perhaps
more
conveniently
nomindtiv
nominativus
pendens
a
form
of
anacoluthon
in
which
a
sentence
is
begun
with
what
appears
to
be
the
subject
but
before
the
verb
is
reached
something
else
is
substituted
in
word
or
in

and
the
supposed
sub

is
left
in

violent

this
negative
prefix
says
the
cod
is
now
freely
used
its
use
is
indeed
becoming
too
free
it
has
given
us
many
useful
words
of
the
type
of
nonattendance
noncombatant
non
conformist
nonskid
and
nonstop
and
some
useful
differentiations
by
pro
viding

colourless
antonym

the
nonce
ordinary
one
has
acquired
a
positive
implication
eg
noneffective
and
in
effective
nonhuman
and
inhuman
non
moral
and
immoral
nonnatural
and
unnatural
nonprofessional
and
un
professional
but
the
ease
with
which
any
word
can
be
negatived
by
this
device
tempts
the
indolent
to
use
it
unnecessarily
and
to
write
for

nonconcur
for
dissent
non

for

nonsick
for

nonsense

the
idiom
is
make
nonsense
or
make
sense
of
something
without
the
in
definite
article
nor
is
a
word
that
should
come
into
our
minds
as
we
repeat
the
general
confession
most
of
us
in
our
time
have
left
undone
those
things
which
we
ought
to
have
done
ie
failed
to
put
in
nor
when
it
was
wanted
and
done
those
things
which
we
ought
not
to
have
done
ie
thrust
it
in
when
there
was
no
room
for
it
the
nega
tive
forms
of
he
moves
and
speaks
he
both
moves
and
speaks
are
he
moves
not
nor
speaks
he
neither
moves
nor
speaks
or
with
the
verb
resolved
as
is
usual
in
modern
negative
sentences
he
does
not
move
or
speak
he
does
not
either
move
or
speak
the
tendency
to
go
wrong
is
probably
due
to
confusion
between
the
simple
verbs
moves
etc
and
the
resolved
ones
does
move
etc
if
the
verb
is
resolved
there
is
often
an
auxiliary
that
serves
both
clauses
and
as
the
negative
is
attached
to
the
auxiliary
its
force
is
carried
on
together
with
that
of
the
auxiliary
and
no
fresh
negative
is
wanted
two
cautions
are
necessary
on
this
carrying
on
of
the
negative
force
and
consequent
preference
of
or
to
nor
the
first
is
that
it
will
not
do
to
repeat
the
auxiliary
and
yet
use
or
under
the
impression
that
the
previous
negative
suffices
that
is
what
has
been
done
in
he
was
naturally
and
properly
at
pains
to
prove
that
his
company
had
not
acted
negligently
or
carelessly
or
had
been
unduly
influenced
by
reasons
of
economy
there
was
a
choice
here
between
or
been
and
and
had
not
been
or
had
been
makes
nonsense
the
other
caution
much
more
often
required
is
that
if
the
negative
is
nor
attached
not
to
an
auxiliary
or
other
word
common
to
two
clauses
that
will
carry
it
forward
but
to
some
other
part
of
the
first
clause
the
nega
tiye
force
is
cut
off
and
has
to
be
started
afresh
by
nor
the
following
examples
illustrate
the
danger
in
each
or
must
be
corrected
to
nor
if
the
rest
of
the
sentence
is
to
remain
as
it
is
though
some
slight
change
of
arrangement
such
as
is
indicated
would
make
or
possible
in
this
kind
of
work
there
was
often
little
oral
preparation
of
material
little
systematic
collection
of
facts
and
views
well
assimilated
and
digested
or
much
discussion
of
balance
and
proportion
the
writer
has
for
gotten
that
he
began
there
was
often
little
and
has
ended
as
though
he
had
said
there
was
seldom
much
or
must
be
corrected
to
nor
was
there
in
its
six
months
of
power
it
has
offered
not
one
constructive
measure
or
done
a
single
thing
to
relieve
suffering
it
has
not
offered
one
he
did
nothing
with
out
consulting
lovel
or
failed
in
any
thing
without
expecting
and
fearing
his
admonishing
he
did
not
do
anything
or
fail
the
above
are
the
ordinary
types
of
mistake
with
nor
others
that
should
hardly
require
mention
are
either
nor
and
the
poetical
omission
of
the
first
negative
either
nor
is
as
bad
as
neither
or
there
was
not
either
in
in
italy
nor
on
the
mediterranean
coast
of
spain

any
british

from

of

but
the
very
popularity
of
the
idiom
in
english
is
proof
enough
that
there
is
something
in
it
congenial
to
the
english
temperament
and
it
is
pleasant
to
believe
that
it
owes
its
success
with
us
to
a
stubborn
national
dislike
of
putting
things
too
strongly
it
is
clear
too
that
there
are
contexts
to
which
for

more
suitable

seem
to
anticipate
and
put
aside
instead
of
not
foreseeing
or
ignoring
the
possible
suggestion
that
soandso
is
inconsiderable
the
right
principle
is
to
acknowledge
that
the
idiom
is
allowable
and
then
to
avoid
it
except
when
it
is
more
than
allowable
examples
occur
in

news
papers

their

would
hardly
claim
that
elegance

was

admit
that
they
used
it
only
because
they
saw
no
reason
why
they
should
not
such
are
the
style
of
argument
suitable
for
the
election
contest
is
no
doubt
not
infrequently
different
from
the
style
of
argument
suitable
for
use
at
westminster
often
one
may
imagine
that
mr

not
be
altogether
unrelieved
when
his

actor

will
be
much
relieved
not
in
exclamations
but
if
you
look
at
the
story
of
that
quadrilateral
of
land
what
a
complex
of
change
and
diversity
do
you
not
discover
a
jumble
of
question
and
exclamation
the
right
exclamation
would
be
what

the
possible

not

essentially
interrogative

explic

that

methinks
my

nothing

it

the

either
sense

as

my

they

then
leaves
the

open

the
risks
of
ambiguity
are
very
great
if
the
sense
of
they

n
i

an

did
not
happen
to
be
fixed
by
trusting
to

who
would

very

called

in

both
the

comment
in

it
will
be
a
sur
prise
and
to
some
an
agreeable
one
if
at
this
late
stage
in
our
change
from
an
inflexional
to
an
analytic
language
we
revert
to
a
free
use
of
the
case
that
we
formerly
tended
more
and
more
to
restrict
it
begins
to
seem
likely
that
drinks
victims
will
before
long
be
the
natural
and
no
longer
the
affected
or
rhetorical
version
of
the
victims
of
drink
the
devotees
of
inflexion
may
do
well
to
rejoice
the
change
may
improve
rather
than
injure
the
lan
guage
and
if
that
is
so
let
due
praise
be
bestowed
on
the
newspaper
press
which
is
bringing
it
about
but
to
the
present
or
perhaps
already
past
generation
which
has
been
instinc

aware
of
differences
between
drinks
victims
and
the
victims
of

now

them
scornfully

attribute
to
forget
for

that
though
nursery
school
is
a
legitimate
use
of
the

nursery
school
provi
sion
is
an
ugly
and

way
of

here
is
the
opinion
of

on

english
his
desire
to
use
so
far
as
possible
only
words
which
are
purely
english
limited
his
vocabulary
and
was
some
drawback
to
his
sentences
say
the
truth
is
perhaps
that
conscious
deliberate
saxonism
is
folly
that
the
choice
or
rejection
of
particular
words
should
depend
not
on
their
descent
but
on
considerations
of
expressive
ness
intelligibility
brevity
euphony
or
ease
of
handling
at
the
same
time
any
writer
who
becomes
aware
that
the
saxon
or
native
english
element
in
what
he
writes
is
small
will
do
well
to
take
the
fact
as
a
dangersignal
but
the
way
to
act
on
that
signal
is
not
to
translate
his
romance
words
into
saxon
ones
it
is
to
avoid
abstract
and
roundabout
and
bookish
phrasing
whenever
the
nature
of
the
thing
to
be
said
does
not
require
it
antisaxonism
is
not
like
saxonism
a
creed
there
are
indeed
properly
speaking
no
antisaxonists
the
term
is
here
used
as
a
name
for
the
frame
of
mind
that
turns
away
not
so
much
from
the
etymologically
english
voca
bulary
as
from
the
homely
or
the
simple
or
the
clear
it
is
a
practice
and
a
propensity
that
go
far
to
account
for
the
follies
of
saxonism
happenings
and
birdlore
and
bodeful
and
the
like
are
the
products
of
a
healthy
revulsion
from
the
turgid
taste
that
finds
satisfac
tion
in
such
words
as
adumbrate

vague

a
recommendation
to
one
kind
of
writer
as
saving
him
the
trouble
of
choosing
between
words

pre

i
the
idea
is
so
preposterous
that
by
the
time
this
is
in

it
may
be
definitely
scotched
these
writers
might
perhaps
plead
that
they
were
not
using
macbeths
word
but
drew
their
metaphor
from
the
scotch
thought
to
be
of
different
origin
that
is
placed
under
a
wheel
to
prevent
it
from
moving

the
plea
is
not
con
vincing

cannot
escape

reproach
of

a

when

this
there
is
out

struck
out

as
a
substantive
verb
ie
exist
that
even
when
there
is
no
in
version
the
need
is
felt
of
inserting
it
as
a
sign
that
the
verb
must
be
taken
in
its
substantive
sense
not
as
aux
iliary
or
copulative
but
with
other
verbs
about
which
there
is
no
such
doubt
no
such
sign
is
wanted
and
there
is
used
only
with
inversion
the
second
thing
that
calls
for
notice
is
that
since
in
the
there
idiom
verb
precedes
subject
there
is
a
danger
of
the
verbs
being
hastily
put
into
the
wrong
number
for
examples
see
number
thereafter
thereat
therein
there
of
thereto
therewith
etc
the
re
mark
at
the
end
of
the
article
there
fore
applies
also
to
these
compounds
thereby
the
use
of
t
after
a
num
ber
etc
half
a
dozen
or
t
is
scottish
the
english
idiom
being
or
thereabouts
or
or
so
a
special
tribunal
will
be
therefor
therefore
constituted
to
try
the
accused
thereby
assuring
him
the
guarantees
essential
to
the
right
of
defence
for
this
use
of
f
with
an
unattached
participle
as
surings
noun
is
not
tribunal
but
an
inferred
constitution
see
that
article
and
thus
which
is
more
frequently
resorted
to
in
similar
difficulties
in
the
following
example
it
is
clear
that
thereby
means
by
the
salary
etc
but
whether
affording
agrees
with
salary
etc
so
that
the
salary
affords
encour
agement
by
the
salary
or
whether
it
agrees
with
firm
looming
in
the
distance
the
writer
probably
knows
as
little
as
we
the
latter
is
usually
the
recipient
of
a
liberal
salary
and
expenses
with
periodical
increments
holidays
and
security
thereby
affording
every
en
couragement
to
promote
the
interests
of
his
firm
therefor
therefore
the
two
are
now
distinct
in
accent
and
meaning
as
well
as
in
spelling
therefor
is
accented
on
the
second
syllable
there
fore
on
the
first
and
therefor
is
to
be
used
only
where
for
that
for
it
for
them
etc
could
stand
equally
well
in
grammatical
terms
therefore
is
an
adverbial
conjunction
and
therefor
an
adverbial
or
adjectival
phrase
adver
bial
in
he
was
punished
therefor
and
adjectival
in
the
penalty
therefor
is
death
the
essential
function
of
there
fore
is
to
make
clear
the
relation
of
its
sentence
to
what
has
gone
before
that
of
therefor
is
the
same
as
that
of
there
after
thereat
therein
thereof
thereto
therewith
etc
usual
in
legal
documents
but
elsewhere
serving
only
to
give
a
touch
of
formality
or
archaism
to
the
sentence
in
which
it
is
substituted
for
the
for
it
etc
of
natural
speech
therefore
apart
from
the
danger
of
meaning
therefor
and
writing
there
fore
or
vice
versa
the
only
caution
needed
is
that
discretion
is
necessary
in
the
use
of
commas
before
and
after
words
of
the
class
to
which
t
belongs
like
then
accordingly
nevertheless
consequently
and
many
others
it
is
an
adverb
often
used
itself
indeed
al
most
always
as
a
conjunction
and
it
is
a
matter
of
taste
whether
such
adver
bial
conjunctions
shall
or
shall
not
be
commad
off
from
the
rest
of
the
sen
tence
in
which
they
stand
light
punc
tuators
usually
omit
the
commas
or
comma
if
t
stands
first
heavy
punc
tuators
usually
give
them
and
both
are
within
their
rights
but
it
must
be
re
membered
that
the
putting
of
a
comma
before
t
inevitably
has
the
effect
of
throwing
a
strong
accent
on
the
pre
ceding
word
and
that
some
preceding
words
are
equal
to
that
burden
and
some
are
not
from
the
three
follow
ing
examples
it
will
be
at
once
apparent
that
the
although
can
bear
the
commas
and
the
ands
cannot
although
there
fore
the
element
of
surprise
could
not
come
into
play
on
this
occasion
the
germans
were
forced
to
withdraw
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
state
to
pay
such
prices
and
therefore
we
must
con
tent
ourselves
with
malaria
was
the
cause
of
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
sickness
and
therefore
the
disease
de
serves
especial
study
by
again
the
word
it
is
one
that
can
seldom
be
emphasized
and
conse
quently
abhors
a
commad
therefore
such
as
fodows
it
in
it
therefore
comes
rather
as
a
shock
to
find
simul
taneously
in
many
papers
this
morning
articles
declaring
it
therefore
behoves
those
who
have
made
the
pas
sage
of
the
bill
possible
to
attend
once
more
but
where
emphasis
can
reason
ably
be
laid
on
it
and
it
can
mean
it
more
than
others
or
the
like
the
commas
become
at
least
tolerable
so
it
is
a
concrete
and
definite
idea
the
embodiment
of
which
in
practicable
shape
is
by
far
the
most
urgent
construc
tive
problem
of
international
statesman
ship
and
it
therefore
calls
for
the
most
careful
examination
many
words
however
are
neither
naturally
emphatic
like
although
nor
naturally
unemphatic
like
and
and
it
and
after
them
care
should
be
taken
not
to
use
the
commas
with
therefore
except
when
emphasis
is
intended
the
personal
pronouns
are
good
ex
amples
in
the
following
we
ought
to
be
able
to
conclude
from
the
commas
that
we
are
being
deliberately
con
trasted
with
others
who
believe
other
they
they
wise
we
therefore
find
great
comfort
in
believing
that
canadian
loyalty
de
pends
not
on
nor
on
but
on
probably
that
is
the
case
and
the
com
mas
are
justified
but
if
the
light
punc
tuation
were
generally
accepted
as
the
rule
with
these
adverbial
conjunctions
and
commas
used
only
when
emphasis
on
the
preceding
word
was
desired
one
of
the
numberless
small
points
that
make
for
lucidity
would
be
gained
a
curious
specimen
may
be
added
we
therefore
are
brought
again
to
the
study
of
symptoms
here
it
is
obvious
that
we
is
unemphatic
but
the
writer
though
he
has
rightly
abstained
from
commas
has
been
perverse
enough
to
throw
an
accent
on
we
by
other
means
viz
by
putting
therefore
before
instead
of
after

impossible
gram
mar
but
as
a
reasonable
explanation
of
what
is
believed
to
be
the
fact
that
good
writers
do
not
say
it
but
say
either
the
persons
named
or
those
named
the
following
quotation
is
useful
as
containing
samples
both
of
the
right
and
of
the
wrong
usage
it
depends
upon
the
extent
to
which
those
in
authority
understand
their
responsi
bility
and
are
able
so
to
make
their
influence
felt
as
to
enlist
the
active
sup
port
of
those
boys
with
most
influence
in
the
school
those
in
authority
is
right
whereas
those
persons
in
authority
would
have
been
wrong
and
those
boys
with
most
influence
is
wrong
and
should
be
the
boys
with
etc
the
following
use
of
those
is
quite
another
matter
and
of
no
importance
but
worth
giving
as
a
curiosity
it
is
impossible
for
the
ambassador
to
issue

cannot
resist
the
impression
that
it
would
be
doing

an
ill
service
to
the
point
shown
by
the
first
is
that
the
omission
must
not
be
made

it

the
participle
or

apparently
attached

a
wrong
noun
new
in

belongs
to
she
but
seems
to
belong
to
a
lady
master
if
she
is
had
not
been
omitted
after
though
all
would
have
been
in
order
in
the
poland
sentence
the
correction
really
required
is
to
omit
though
sympathizing
as
i
do
being
selfsufficient
but
even
if
we
suppose
as
i
do
omitted
there
is
a
wrong
sound
about
though
sympathizing
itself
that
suggests
a
limitation
on
this
idiom
though
and
other
conjunctions
must
not
be
constructed
with
a
participle
unless
that
participle
would
have
been
used
in
the
unabridged
clause
and
that
would
not
have
been
though
i
am
sympathizing
but
though
i
sympathize

see
less

worth
while
in
certain
uses
great
confusion
prevails
which
can
be
cleared
up
with
the
aid
of
grammar
the
important
fact
is
that
the
adjective
worth
requires
what
is
most
easily
de
scribed
as
an
object
it
is
meaningless
to
say
this
is
worth
but
sense
to
say
this
is
worth
sixpence
or
this
is
worth
saying
ie
the
necessary
expenditure
of
words
or
this
is
worth
while
ie
the
necessary
expenditure
of
time
but
one
such
object
satisfies
its
require
ments
so
that
this
is
worth
while
say
ing
with
the
separate
objects
while
and
saying
is
ungrammatical
worth
with
two
objects
there
is
no
need
to
give
more
than
two
examples
of
this
mistake
all
that
is
necessary
to
set
them
right
is
to
omit
while
leaving
worth
with
one
object
onlyturning
in
the
first
and
pursuing
in
the
second
a
spare
captain
to
take
charge
of
any
prize
that
might
be
worth
while
turning
into
a
raider
was
not
that
a
line
worth
while
pursuing
worth
with
no
object
the
commonest
cause
of
this
mistake
is
the
anticipatory
it
see
it
i
and
as
is
there
explained
the
function
of
the
anticipatory
it
is
to
herald
a
deferred
subject
it
follows
that
such
a
sentence
as
it
is
worth
saying
this
is
equivalent
to
it
namely
saying
this
is
worth
worth
is
left
without
an
object
and
nonsense
results
such
sentences
if
they
are
short
and
simple
can
be
corrected
in
one
of
two
ways
either
by
getting
rid
of
the
it
or
by
inserting
while
it
is
worth
quoting
the
echo

can
be
rewritten
either
the
echo
de

is
worth
quoting
or
it
is

etc
it
is
worth

this
method
of
approach
can
be
rewritten
either
this
method
of
approach
is
worth
dwelling
on
or
it
is
worth
while
to

on
etc
for
longer
and
more
complex
sentences
the
insertion
of
while
may
be
the
only
remedy
as
in
it
is
worth
recalling
lord
salisburys
declaration
in
that
if
she
yielded
to
pressure
we
would
consider
ourselves
released
from
our
obligations
if
an
initial
it
is
not
anticipatory
but
an
ordinary
pronoun
the
case
is
of
course
quite
different
in
have
said
this
because
it
is
zvorth
saying
it
is
a
pronoun
whose
antecedent
is

rightly
given

one
objectsaying
to

the
following
quotation
shows
the
risk
of
confusion
in
your
excellent
account
of
the
late
miss
there
is
one
omission
and
it
is
worth
filling
it
up
here
the
first
it
is
anticipatory
meaning
filling
it
up
and
the
second
is
the
ordinary

it

that

people
ignore
the
existence
of
wroth
and
treat
wrath
as
both
noun

adjective
pronouncing
it
always
rawth

that
the
useful

anger

for

to
be
the
adjective
angry

pronounced

this
does
not
put
wrathful
out

it

the
attributive
adjective

wroth
is
the
predicative

usual
in

degrees
to

of
the
english

the

of

in

borrowed

the
pronunciation

z
as
in

lish
plurals
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
some
day
all
of
these
that
are
in
familiar
english
use
will
be
anglicized
with
s
but
a
list
of
the
chief
words
here
given
with
an
english
plural
in
order
that
the
reader
may
judge
of
their
looks
is
admittedly
forbidding
adieus
beaus
chteaus
flambeaus
plateaus
port
manteaus
rouleaus
tableaus
trous
seaus
the
fact
however
that
purlieu
which
has
all
the
air
of
a
french
word
without
being
one
looks
right
with
the
plural
s
purlieus
because
we
are
used
to
it
suggests
that
courage
with
the
others
might
soon
be
rewarded
for
all
of
them
except
beau
chateau
and
tableau
the
cod
admits
a
plural
in
s
as
an
alternative
phrases
such
as
feux
de
joie
and
jeux
desprit
would
naturally
keep
their
french
x
and
so
would
any
single
words
whose
angli
cization
was
so
far
from
accomplished
that
the
plural
was
still
pronounced
like
the
singular
without
the
sibilant
that
is
hardly
true
of
any
of
the
list
above

xion

there
is
a
doubt
whether

the

are
also
concerned

deflexion

all
called

the

the
etymological
spellings
in
the
first
y
andi
place
each
is
derived
from
an
actual
latin
noun
in
xio
the
change
to
english
ction
being
due
partly
to
the
influence
of
the
verbs
connect
and
de
in
re
fleet
and
partly
to
that
of
the
multitude
of
english
nouns
in
tion
and
secondly
a
vast
majority
of
nouns
in
ion
were
formed
from
the
pp
stem
and
not
from
the
present
stem
of
latin
verbs
so
that
flecto
flex
and
necto
nex
would
be
expected
to
use
flex
and
nex
as
the
basis
of
their
ion
nouns
as
a
few
latin
nouns
in
io
were
nevertheless
formed
from
present
stems
eg
oblivio
the
philo
logical
lapse
is
of
no
great
importance
it
may
be
well
to
retain
the
x
in
con
nexion
deflexion
and
inflexion
in
which
it
has
by
no
means
gone
out
of
use
though
the
earlier
connexive
has
been
displaced
by
connective
for
reflection
and
reflexion
reflective
and
reflexive

which
attempts
at

had

were
in
older

writing
freely
interchanged
that
general
liberty
has
long
been
abandoned
but
there
are
still
a
few
words
in
which
usage
varies
or
mistakes
are
common
they
are
in
the
spelling
here
recommended
as
the
better
though
not
in
all
cases
eg
tire

prevailing
one
in

and

stymie
tiler
tire
of
wheel
tiro
wych
elm
in
libya
sibyl
and
mytilene
the
right
spelling
is
indisputable
but
with
the
same
sound
in
successive
syllables
it
is
difficult
to
remember
which
is
i
and
which
y
even
those
yankee
who
have
read
herodotus
and
thucy
dides
often
have
to
visualize
the
greek
words
before
they
feel
safe
lydia
makes
them
pause
over
libya
and
as
a
name
in
current
use
sybil
is
com
moner
than
sibyl
in
cypher
lychgate
syllabub
sylvan
syphon
syren
and
tyro
the
intrusive
y
is
probably
due
to
a
vague
feeling
that
an
unenglish
looking
word
is
all
the
better
for
a
little
aggravation
of
its
unenglishness
in
tyler
and
tyre
differentiation
may
have
been
at
work
but
without
need
and
on
tyre
it
may
be
added
that
in
some
peoples
opinion
to
say
that
tire
is
the
american
spelling
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
our
using
tyre
on
the
con
trary
agreement
between
english
and
american
spelling
is
much
to
be
de
sired
wherever
it
is
practicable
in
gipsy

pigmy
we
have
dissimi
lation
again
without
need
for
if
invisibility
can
carry
five
is
these
can
surely
do
with
two
vs
but
the
fact
that
stymie
has
prevailed
over
both
stimy
and
stymy
illustrates
the
power
of
dissimilation
and
it
may
be
guessed
that
the
y
starts
in
the
oftener
used
stymied
in
which
the
necessary
i
of
the
second
syllable
tends
to
produce
y
in
the
first
with
this
compare
the
greater
frequency
of
the
correct
y
in
gypsies
and
pygmies
than
in
gypsy
and
pygmy
on
the
words
in
the
list
that
are
in
small
capitals
further
remarks

be
found
in

mistaken

originally
the
nickname

it
was
extended
contemptuously
by
the
confederates
during

to
all
soldiers
of
the
federal

the
derivation
of
the

the
last

that
the

a
noun
the
last

an
adverb
indeed
far
from
the
quinquenniums
ending
the

the

the
quinquennium
it
is
the
same
kind
of
mistake
as

twice
in

different

in

yellowhammer
it
cannot
be
said
with
safety
either
that
the
h
is
due
to
ignorant
assimilation
by
popular
ety
mology
to
hammer
or
that
the
absence
of
h
is
mere
zdropping
each
form
has
an
etymological
theory
on
its
side

says
that
both
forms
are
historically
justifiable
the
only
reason
for
resisting
the
prevalent
h
is
thus
removed
yeoman
yeoman
service

yeo

both
idiomatic

the
greater
ease

other
combinations

are
incongruous
except
in

in

poetic
prose
it
is
true
that
yestereve

shorter
than

evening
but
the
saving
of
space
is
paid
for
by
the
proof
that

no
literary
sense

an
adversative
adverb
or

contrast
the
opposi

that

in
this
respect

the
yet
sen
tence
is
in
contrast
is
by
no
means
the
essential
contents
of
the
previous
sentence
but
has
to
be
got
out
of
it
at
the
cost
of
some
thought
we
confess
to
being
surprised
at
the
line
taken
by
the
railwaymen
at
crewe
with
reference
to
colonel
yorkers
conclusion
that
the
shrewsbury
disaster
occurred
through
the
enginedriver
having
momentarily
fallen
asleep
yet
at
a
meeting
the
crewe
railwaymen
are
very
indignant
at
the
suggestion
and
denounce
colonel
yorke
as
an
army
officer
who
does
not
under
stand
the
real
working
of
railways
here
the
yet
fact
is
that
the
men
are
indig
nant
what
is
that
in
contrast
with
apparently
with
the
correctness
of
colonel
yorkes
conclusion
but
though
many
other
things
not
in
con
trast
with
their
indignation
can
be
got
out
of
the
sentence
the
correctness
of
the
conclusion
is
inferable
only
from
the
newspapers
surprise
at
the
mens
indignation
at
the
conclusion
if
yet
were
omitted
the
second
sentence
would
come
in
logically
enough
as
an
explanation
of
what
the
mens
line
referred
to
had
actually
been
sir
i
doubt
if
sufficient
attention
has
been
drawn
to
the
injustice
of
throwing
on
the
landlord
in
whose
house
they
hap
pen
to
be
resident
the
cost
of
a
large
additional
insurance
benefit
for
those
who
are
sick
yet
under
clause
a
sick
tenant
would
be
able
to
live
rent
free
for
a
year
at
the
expense
of
his
or
her
landlord
this
is
a
less
glaring
case
the
essence
of
the
yet
sentence
is
that
a
tenant
has
power
to
injure
a
land
lord
what
is
that
in
contrast
with
with
the
fact
that
justice
should
protect
landlords
that
is
not
with
the
main
sentenceprecedingwhichisa
statement
of
why
the
writer
is
writing
but
with
a
mere
inference
from
a
noun
that
occurs
in
it
viz
injustice
as
in
the
first
example
the
logical
work
of
the
second
sentence
is
to
explain
the
nature
of
a
noun
contained
in
the
first
but
an
explanation
is
presented
in
the
guise
of
contrast
the
sentence
would
do
its
work
properly
if
yet
were
omit
ted
no
doubt
the
contrast
that
was
at
the
back
of
the
writers
mind
but
did
not
come
to
the
front
of
it
was
between
the
greatness
of
the
injustice
and
the
lack
of
public
interest
in
it
yet
in
its
temporal
sense
may
be
ambiguous
its
old
sense
of
now
as
before
still
has
lasted
longer
in
scotland
and
ireland
than
in

to
a
