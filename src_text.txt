Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware.[3] Intel is one of the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturers by revenue[4][5] and ranked in the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue for nearly a decade, from 2007 to 2016 fiscal years, until it was removed from the ranking in 2018.[6] In 2020, it was reinstated and ranked 45th, being the 7th-largest technology company in the ranking.

Intel supplies microprocessors for most manufacturers of computer systems, and is one of the developers of the x86 series of instruction sets found in most personal computers (PCs). It also manufactures chipsets, network interface controllers, flash memory, graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and other devices related to communications and computing. Intel has a strong presence in the high-performance general-purpose and gaming PC market with its Intel Core line of CPUs, whose high-end models are among the fastest consumer CPUs, as well as its Intel Arc series of GPUs, and sponsors the Intel Extreme Masters, a series of international esports tournaments. The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open source projects such as Wayland, Mesa, Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.[7]

Intel (Integrated electronics) was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore (of Moore's law) and Robert Noyce, along with investor Arthur Rock, and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove.[8] The company was a key component of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high-tech center, as well as being an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the PC in the early 1990s that this became its primary business.

During the 1990s, the partnership between Microsoft Windows and Intel, known as "Wintel", became instrumental in shaping the PC landscape[9] and solidified Intel's position on the market. As a result, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs in the mid to late 1990s, fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period, it became the dominant supplier of PC microprocessors and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against AMD, as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.[10][11]

Since the 2000s and especially the late 2010s, Intel has faced increasing competition from AMD, resulting in a significant decline of its dominance and market share in the PC market.[12] Nevertheless, with a 68.4% market share as of 2023, Intel still leads the x86 market by a wide margin.[13]

In 2023, Dell accounted for about 19% of Intel's total revenues, Lenovo accounted for 11% of total revenues, and HP Inc. accounted for 10% of total revenues.[1] As of August 2021, the US Department of Defense is another large customer for Intel.

According to IDC, while Intel enjoyed the biggest market share in both the overall worldwide PC microprocessor market (73.3%) and the mobile PC microprocessor (80.4%) in the second quarter of 2011, the numbers decreased by 1.5% and 1.9% compared to the first quarter of 2011.[20][21]

Intel's market share decreased significantly in the enthusiast market as of 2019,[22] and they have faced delays for their 10 nm products. According to former Intel CEO Bob Swan, the delay was caused by the company's overly aggressive strategy for moving to its next node.

In the 1980s, Intel was among the world's top ten sellers of semiconductors (10th in 1987[24]). Along with Microsoft Windows, it was part of the "Wintel" personal computer domination in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 1992, Intel became the biggest chip maker by revenue and held the position until 2018 when Samsung Electronics surpassed it, but Intel returned to its former position the year after.[25][26] Other major semiconductor companies include TSMC, GlobalFoundries, Texas Instruments, Toshiba, STMicroelectronics, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Micron, SK Hynix, Kioxia, and SMIC. 

Intel's competitors in PC chipsets included AMD, VIA Technologies, Silicon Integrated Systems, and Nvidia. Intel's competitors in networking include NXP Semiconductors, Infineon,[needs update] Broadcom Limited, Marvell Technology Group and Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, and competitors in flash memory included Spansion, Samsung Electronics, Qimonda, Kioxia, STMicroelectronics, Micron, and SK Hynix.

The only major competitor in the x86 processor market is AMD, with which Intel has had full cross-licensing agreements since 1976: each partner can use the other's patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time.[27] However, the cross-licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an AMD bankruptcy or takeover.[28]

Some smaller competitors, such as VIA Technologies, produce low-power x86 processors for small factor computers and portable equipment. However, the advent of such mobile computing devices, in particular, smartphones, has in recent years led to a decline in PC sales.[29] Since over 95% of the world's smartphones currently use processors cores designed by Arm, using the Arm instruction set, Arm has become a major competitor for Intel's processor market. Arm is also planning to make attempts at setting foot into the PC and server market, with Ampere and IBM each individually designing CPUs for servers and supercomputers.[30] The only other major competitor in processor instruction sets is RISC-V, which is an open source CPU instruction set. The major Chinese phone and telecommunications manufacturer Huawei has released chips based on the RISC-V instruction set due to US sanctions.[31]

Intel has been involved in several disputes regarding the violation of antitrust laws, which are noted below. 

Origins
Andy Grove, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore in 1978

Intel was incorporated in Mountain View, California, on July 18, 1968, by Gordon E. Moore (known for "Moore's law"), a chemist, Robert Noyce, a physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit and Arthur Rock, an investor and venture capitalist.[40][41][42] Moore and Noyce had left Fairchild Semiconductor and were part of the "traitorous eight". There were originally 500,000 shares outstanding of which Dr. Noyce bought 245,000 shares, Dr. Moore 245,000 shares, and Mr. Rock 10,000 shares; all at $1 per share. Rock offered $2,500,000 of convertible debentures to a limited group of private investors (equivalent to $21 million in 2022), convertible at $5 per share.[43][44] Just 2 years later, Intel became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO), raising $6.8 million ($23.50 per share).[45] Intel's third employee was Andy Grove,[note 1] a chemical engineer, who later ran the company through much of the 1980s and the high-growth 1990s.

In deciding on a name, Moore and Noyce quickly rejected "Moore Noyce",[46] near homophone for "more noise" – an ill-suited name for an electronics company, since noise in electronics is usually undesirable and typically associated with bad interference. Instead, they founded the company as NM Electronics (or MN Electronics) on July 18, 1968, but by the end of the month had changed the name to Intel, which stood for Integrated Electronics.[note 2] Since "Intel" was already trademarked by the hotel chain Intelco, they had to buy the rights for the name.[45][52]
Early history

At its founding, Intel was distinguished by its ability to make logic circuits using semiconductor devices. The founders' goal was the semiconductor memory market, widely predicted to replace magnetic-core memory. Its first product, a quick entry into the small, high-speed memory market in 1969, was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit static random-access memory (SRAM), which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan.[53][54] In the same year, Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory (ROM)[55] and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) silicon gate SRAM chip, the 256-bit 1101.[45][56][57]

While the 1101 was a significant advance, its complex static cell structure made it too slow and costly for mainframe memories. The three-transistor cell implemented in the first commercially available dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the 1103 released in 1970, solved these issues. The 1103 was the bestselling semiconductor memory chip in the world by 1972, as it replaced core memory in many applications.[58][59] Intel's business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products, still dominated by various memory devices.
Federico Faggin, designer of the Intel 4004

Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971.[45] The microprocessor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry, as it miniaturized the central processing unit of a computer, which then made it possible for small machines to perform calculations that in the past only very large machines could do. Considerable technological innovation was needed before the microprocessor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a "mini computer" and then known as a "personal computer".[60] Intel also created one of the first microcomputers in 1973.[56][61]

Intel opened its first international manufacturing facility in 1972, in Malaysia, which would host multiple Intel operations, before opening assembly facilities and semiconductor plants in Singapore and Jerusalem in the early 1980s, and manufacturing and development centers in China, India, and Costa Rica in the 1990s.[62] By the early 1980s, its business was dominated by DRAM chips. However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market. The growing success of the IBM personal computer, based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model. Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success.

By the end of the 1980s, buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market, Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary (and most profitable) hardware supplier to the PC industry, part of the winning 'Wintel' combination. Moore handed over his position as CEO to Andy Grove in 1987. By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991, Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection, so that by the end of the 1990s, its line of Pentium processors had become a household name.
Challenges to dominance (2000s)

After 2000, growth in demand for high-end microprocessors slowed. Competitors, most notably AMD (Intel's largest competitor in its primary x86 architecture market), garnered significant market share, initially in low-end and mid-range processors but ultimately across the product range, and Intel's dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced,[63] mostly due to controversial NetBurst microarchitecture. In the early 2000s then-CEO, Craig Barrett attempted to diversify the company's business beyond semiconductors, but few of these activities were ultimately successful.
Litigation

Intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation. U.S. law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology (circuit layouts), until the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).[64] During the late 1980s and 1990s (after this law was passed), Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the 80386 CPU.[65] The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills, even if Intel lost the suits.[65] Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in 1991. In 2004 and 2005, AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition.
Reorganization and success with Intel Core (2005–2015)

In 2005, CEO Paul Otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms (enterprise, digital home, digital health, and mobility).

On June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs, then CEO of Apple, announced that Apple would be using Intel's x86 processors for its Macintosh computers, switching from the PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance.[66] This was seen as win for Intel;[67] an analyst called the move "risky" and "foolish", as Intel's current offerings at the time were considered to be behind those of AMD and IBM.[68]

In 2006, Intel unveiled its Core microarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim; the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field.[69][70] In 2008, Intel had another "tick" when it introduced the Penryn microarchitecture, fabricated using the 45 nm process node. Later that year, Intel released a processor with the Nehalem architecture to positive reception.[71]

On June 27, 2006, the sale of Intel's XScale assets was announced. Intel agreed to sell the XScale processor business to Marvell Technology Group for an estimated $600 million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities. The move was intended to permit Intel to focus its resources on its core x86 and server businesses, and the acquisition completed on November 9, 2006.[72]

In 2008, Intel spun off key assets of a solar startup business effort to form an independent company, SpectraWatt Inc. In 2011, SpectraWatt filed for bankruptcy.[73]

In February 2011, Intel began to build a new microprocessor manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona, completed in 2013 at a cost of $5 billion.[74] The building is now the 10 nm-certified Fab 42 and is connected to the other Fabs (12, 22, 32) on Ocotillo Campus via an enclosed bridge known as the Link.[75][76][77][78] The company produces three-quarters of its products in the United States, although three-quarters of its revenue come from overseas.[79]

The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Intel is part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also includes Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.[80]
Attempts at entering the smartphone market

In April 2011, Intel began a pilot project with ZTE Corporation to produce smartphones using the Intel Atom processor for China's domestic market. In December 2011, Intel announced that it reorganized several of its business units into a new mobile and communications group[81] that would be responsible for the company's smartphone, tablet, and wireless efforts. Intel planned to introduce Medfield – a processor for tablets and smartphones – to the market in 2012, as an effort to compete with Arm.[82] As a 32-nanometer processor, Medfield is designed to be energy-efficient, which is one of the core features in Arm's chips.[83]

At the Intel Developers Forum (IDF) 2011 in San Francisco, Intel's partnership with Google was announced. In January 2012, Google announced Android 2.3, supporting Intel's Atom microprocessor.[84][85][86] In 2013, Intel's Kirk Skaugen said that Intel's exclusive focus on Microsoft platforms was a thing of the past and that they would now support all "tier-one operating systems" such as Linux, Android, iOS, and Chrome.[87]

In 2014, Intel cut thousands of employees in response to "evolving market trends",[88] and offered to subsidize manufacturers for the extra costs involved in using Intel chips in their tablets. In April 2016, Intel cancelled the SoFIA platform and the Broxton Atom SoC for smartphones,[89][90][91][92] effectively leaving the smartphone market.[93][94]
Intel custom foundry

Finding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the Ultrabook to gain market traction and with PC sales declining, in 2013 Intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for Altera using a 14 nm process. General Manager of Intel's custom foundry division Sunit Rikhi indicated that Intel would pursue further such deals in the future.[95] This was after poor sales of Windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers, except for Qualcomm, which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer, Apple.[96]

As of July 2013, five companies were using Intel's fabs via the Intel Custom Foundry division: Achronix, Tabula, Netronome, Microsemi, and Panasonic – most are field-programmable gate array (FPGA) makers, but Netronome designs network processors. Only Achronix began shipping chips made by Intel using the 22 nm Tri-Gate process.[97][98] Several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time.[99]

The foundry business was closed in 2018 due to Intel's issues with its manufacturing.[100][101]
Security and manufacturing challenges (2016–2021)

Intel continued its tick-tock model of a microarchitecture change followed by a die shrink until the 6th-generation Core family based on the Skylake microarchitecture. This model was deprecated in 2016, with the release of the 7th-generation Core family (codenamed Kaby Lake), ushering in the process–architecture–optimization model. As Intel struggled to shrink their process node from 14 nm to 10 nm, processor development slowed down and the company continued to use the Skylake microarchitecture until 2020, albeit with optimizations.[23]
10 nm process node issues

While Intel originally planned to introduce 10 nm products in 2016, it later became apparent that there were manufacturing issues with the node.[102] The first microprocessor under that node, Cannon Lake (marketed as 8th-generation Core), was released in small quantities in 2018.[103][104] The company first delayed the mass production of their 10 nm products to 2017.[105][106] They later delayed mass production to 2018,[107] and then to 2019. Despite rumors of the process being cancelled,[108] Intel finally introduced mass-produced 10 nm 10th-generation Intel Core mobile processors (codenamed "Ice Lake") in September 2019.[109]

Intel later acknowledged that their strategy to shrink to 10 nm was too aggressive.[23][110] While other foundries used up to four steps in 10 nm or 7 nm processes, the company's 10 nm process required up to five or six multi-pattern steps.[111] In addition, Intel's 10 nm process is denser than its counterpart processes from other foundries.[112][113] Since Intel's microarchitecture and process node development were coupled, processor development stagnated.[23]
Security flaws

In early January 2018, it was reported that all Intel processors made since 1995,[114] excluding Intel Itanium and pre-2013 Intel Atom processors, have been subject to two security flaws dubbed Meltdown and Spectre.[115][116] It is believed that "hundreds of millions" of systems could be affected by these flaws.[117][118] More security flaws were disclosed on May 3, 2018,[119] on August 14, 2018, on January 18, 2019, and on March 5, 2020.[120][121][122][123]

On March 15, 2018, Intel reported that it will redesign its CPUs to protect against the Spectre security vulnerability, the redesigned processors were sold later in 2018.[124][125] Existing chips vulnerable to Meltdown and Spectre can be fixed with a software patch at a cost to performance.[126][127][128][129]
Renewed competition and other developments (2018–present)

Due to Intel's issues with its 10 nm process node and the company's slow processor development,[23] the company now found itself in a market with intense competition.[130] The company's main competitor, AMD, introduced the Zen microarchitecture and a new chiplet-based design to critical acclaim. Since its introduction, AMD, once unable to compete with Intel in the high-end CPU market, has undergone a resurgence,[131] and Intel's dominance and market share have considerably decreased.[132] In addition, Apple began to transition away from the x86 architecture and Intel processors to their own Apple silicon for their Macintosh computers in 2020. The transition is expected to affect Intel minimally; however, it might prompt other PC manufacturers to reevaluate their reliance on Intel and the x86 architecture.[133][134]
'IDM 2.0' strategy

On March 23, 2021, CEO Pat Gelsinger laid out new plans for the company.[135] These include a new strategy, called IDM 2.0, that includes investments in manufacturing facilities, use of both internal and external foundries, and a new foundry business called Intel Foundry Services (IFS), a standalone business unit.[136][137] Unlike Intel Custom Foundry, IFS will offer a combination of packaging and process technology, and Intel's IP portfolio including x86 cores. Other plans for the company include a partnership with IBM and a new event for developers and engineers, called "Intel ON".[101] Gelsinger also confirmed that Intel's 7 nm process is on track, and that the first products using their 7 nm process (also known as Intel 4) are Ponte Vecchio and Meteor Lake.[101]

In January 2022, Intel reportedly selected New Albany, Ohio, near Columbus, Ohio, as the site for a major new manufacturing facility.[138] The facility will cost at least $20 billion.[139] The company expects the facility to begin producing chips by 2025.[140] The same year Intel also choose Magdeburg, Germany, as a site for two new chip mega factories for €17 billion (topping Tesla's investment in Brandenburg). The start of the construction was initially planned for 2023, but this has been postponed to late 2024, while production start is planned for 2027.[141] Including subcontractors this would create 10,000 new jobs.[142]

In August 2022, Intel signed a $30 billion partnership with Brookfield Asset Management to fund its recent factory expansions. As part of the deal, Intel would have a controlling stake by funding 51% of the cost of building new chip-making facilities in Chandler, with Brookfield owning the remaining 49% stake, allowing the companies to split the revenue from those facilities.[143][144]

On January 31, 2023, as part of $3 billion in cost reductions, Intel announced pay cuts affecting employees above midlevel, ranging from 5% upwards. It also suspended bonuses and merit pay increases, while reducing retirement plan matching. These cost reductions followed layoffs announced in the fall of 2022.[145]

In October 2023, Intel confirmed it would be the first commercial user of high-NA EUV lithography tool, as part of its plan to regain process leadership from TSMC.[146] 

SRAMs, DRAMs, and the microprocessor

Intel's first products were shift register memory and random-access memory integrated circuits, and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive DRAM, SRAM, and ROM markets throughout the 1970s. Concurrently, Intel engineers Marcian Hoff, Federico Faggin, Stanley Mazor, and Masatoshi Shima invented Intel's first microprocessor. Originally developed for the Japanese company Busicom to replace a number of ASICs in a calculator already produced by Busicom, the Intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on November 15, 1971, though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel's business until the mid-1980s. (Note: Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor.)

In 1983, at the dawn of the personal computer era, Intel's profits came under increased pressure from Japanese memory-chip manufacturers, and then-president Andy Grove focused the company on microprocessors. Grove described this transition in the book Only the Paranoid Survive. A key element of his plan was the notion, then considered radical, of becoming the single source for successors to the popular 8086 microprocessor.

Until then, the manufacture of complex integrated circuits was not reliable enough for customers to depend on a single supplier, but Grove began producing processors in three geographically distinct factories,[which?] and ceased licensing the chip designs to competitors such as AMD.[148] When the PC industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s, Intel was one of the primary beneficiaries.
Early x86 processors and the IBM PC
The die from an Intel 8742, an 8-bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at 12 MHz, 128 bytes of RAM, 2048 bytes of EPROM, and I/O in the same chip

Despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor, the 4004 and its successors the 8008 and the 8080 were never major revenue contributors at Intel. As the next processor, the 8086 (and its variant the 8088) was completed in 1978, Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed "Operation Crush", and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible. One design win was the newly created IBM PC division, though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time.

IBM introduced its personal computer in 1981, and it was rapidly successful. In 1982, Intel created the 80286 microprocessor, which, two years later, was used in the IBM PC/AT. Compaq, the first IBM PC "clone" manufacturer, produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first 80386-based system, beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC-compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier.

In 1975, the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32-bit microprocessor, finally released in 1981 as the Intel iAPX 432. The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives, and it failed in the marketplace. Intel extended the x86 architecture to 32 bits instead.[149][150]
386 microprocessor

During this period Andrew Grove dramatically redirected the company, closing much of its DRAM business and directing resources to the microprocessor business. Of perhaps greater importance was his decision to "single-source" the 386 microprocessor. Prior to this, microprocessor manufacturing was in its infancy, and manufacturing problems frequently reduced or stopped production, interrupting supplies to customers. To mitigate this risk, these customers typically insisted that multiple manufacturers produce chips they could use to ensure a consistent supply. The 8080 and 8086-series microprocessors were produced by several companies, notably AMD, with which Intel had a technology-sharing contract.

Grove made the decision not to license the 386 design to other manufacturers, instead, producing it in three geographically distinct factories: Santa Clara, California; Hillsboro, Oregon; and Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. He convinced customers that this would ensure consistent delivery. In doing this, Intel breached its contract with AMD, which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new Intel CPU designs any longer. (Instead, AMD started to develop and manufacture its own competing x86 designs.)

As the success of Compaq's Deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant CPU choice, Intel achieved a position of near-exclusive dominance as its supplier. Profits from this funded rapid development of both higher-performance chip designs and higher-performance manufacturing capabilities, propelling Intel to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s.
486, Pentium, and Itanium

Intel introduced the 486 microprocessor in 1989, and in 1990 established a second design team, designing the processors code-named "P5" and "P6" in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years, versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken. Engineers Vinod Dham and Rajeev Chandrasekhar (Member of Parliament, India) were key figures on the core team that developed the 486 chip and later, Intel's signature Pentium chip. The P5 project was earlier known as "Operation Bicycle", referring to the cycles of the processor through two parallel execution pipelines. The P5 was introduced in 1993 as the Intel Pentium, substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number. (Numbers, such as 486, cannot be legally registered as trademarks in the United States.) The P6 followed in 1995 as the Pentium Pro and improved into the Pentium II in 1997. New architectures were developed alternately in Santa Clara, California and Hillsboro, Oregon.

The Santa Clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the x86 architecture, codenamed "P7". The first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with Hewlett-Packard engineers, though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility. The resulting implementation of the IA-64 64-bit architecture was the Itanium, finally introduced in June 2001. The Itanium's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations, and it failed to compete effectively with x86-64, which was AMD's 64-bit extension of the 32-bit x86 architecture (Intel uses the name Intel 64, previously EM64T). In 2017, Intel announced that the Itanium 9700 series (Kittson) would be the last Itanium chips produced.[151][152]

The Hillsboro team designed the Willamette processors (initially code-named P68), which were marketed as the Pentium 4.

During this period, Intel undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns. The first campaign, the 1991 "Intel Inside" marketing and branding campaign, is widely known and has become synonymous with Intel itself. The idea of "ingredient branding" was new at the time, with only NutraSweet and a few others making attempts to do so.[153] One of the key architects of the marketing team was the head of the microprocessor division, David House.[154] He coined the slogan "Intel Inside".[155] This campaign established Intel, which had been a component supplier little-known outside the PC industry, as a household name.

The second campaign, Intel's Systems Group, which began in the early 1990s, showcased manufacturing of PC motherboards, the main board component of a personal computer, and the one into which the processor (CPU) and memory (RAM) chips are plugged.[156] The Systems Group campaign was lesser known than the Intel Inside campaign.

Shortly after, Intel began manufacturing fully configured "white box" systems for the dozens of PC clone companies that rapidly sprang up.[157] At its peak in the mid-1990s, Intel manufactured over 15% of all PCs, making it the third-largest supplier at the time.[citation needed]

During the 1990s, Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) was responsible for many of the hardware innovations for the PC, including the PCI Bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, and Universal Serial Bus (USB). IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video,[citation needed] but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice-president Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial (United States v. Microsoft Corp.).
Pentium flaw
Main article: Pentium FDIV bug

In June 1994, Intel engineers discovered a flaw in the floating-point math subsection of the P5 Pentium microprocessor. Under certain data-dependent conditions, the low-order bits of the result of a floating-point division would be incorrect. The error could compound in subsequent calculations. Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision, and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective Pentium CPUs (which were limited to some 60, 66, 75, 90, and 100 MHz models[158]) on customer request.

The bug was discovered independently in October 1994 by Thomas Nicely, Professor of Mathematics at Lynchburg College. He contacted Intel but received no response. On October 30, he posted a message about his finding on the Internet.[159] Word of the bug spread quickly and reached the industry press. The bug was easy to replicate; a user could enter specific numbers into the calculator on the operating system. Consequently, many users did not accept Intel's statements that the error was minor and "not even an erratum". During Thanksgiving, in 1994, The New York Times ran a piece by journalist John Markoff spotlighting the error. Intel changed its position and offered to replace every chip, quickly putting in place a large end-user support organization. This resulted in a $475 million charge against Intel's 1994 revenue.[160] Dr. Nicely later learned that Intel had discovered the FDIV bug in its own testing a few months before him (but had decided not to inform customers).[161]

The "Pentium flaw" incident, Intel's response to it, and the surrounding media coverage propelled Intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name. Dovetailing with an uptick in the "Intel Inside" campaign, the episode is considered to have been a positive event for Intel, changing some of its business practices to be more end-user focused and generating substantial public awareness, while avoiding a lasting negative impression.[162]
Intel Core
Main article: Intel Core

The Intel Core line originated from the original Core brand, with the release of the 32-bit Yonah CPU, Intel's first dual-core mobile (low-power) processor. Derived from the Pentium M, the processor family used an enhanced version of the P6 microarchitecture. Its successor, the Core 2 family, was released on July 27, 2006. This was based on the Intel Core microarchitecture, and was a 64-bit design.[163] Instead of focusing on higher clock rates, the Core microarchitecture emphasized power efficiency and a return to lower clock speeds.[164] It also provided more efficient decoding stages, execution units, caches, and buses, reducing the power consumption of Core 2-branded CPUs while increasing their processing capacity.

In November 2008, Intel released the 1st-generation Core processors based on the Nehalem microarchitecture. Intel also introduced a new naming scheme, with the three variants now named Core i3, i5, and i7 (as well as i9 from 7th-generation onwards). Unlike the previous naming scheme, these names no longer correspond to specific technical features. It was succeeded by the Westmere microarchitecture in 2010, with a die shrink to 32 nm and included Intel HD Graphics.

In 2011, Intel released the Sandy Bridge-based 2nd-generation Core processor family. This generation featured an 11% performance increase over Nehalem.[165] It was succeeded by Ivy Bridge-based 3rd-generation Core, introduced at the 2012 Intel Developer Forum.[166] Ivy Bridge featured a die shrink to 22 nm, and supported both DDR3 memory and DDR3L chips.

Intel continued its tick-tock model of a microarchitecture change followed by a die shrink until the 6th-generation Core family based on the Skylake microarchitecture. This model was deprecated in 2016, with the release of the 7th-generation Core family based on Kaby Lake, ushering in the process–architecture–optimization model.[167] From 2016 until 2021, Intel later released more optimizations on the Skylake microarchitecture with Kaby Lake R, Amber Lake, Whiskey Lake, Coffee Lake, Coffee Lake R, and Comet Lake.[168][169][170][171] Intel struggled to shrink their process node from 14 nm to 10 nm, with the first microarchitecture under that node, Cannon Lake (marketed as 8th-generation Core), only being released in small quantities in 2018.[103][104]

In 2019, Intel released the 10th-generation of Core processors, codenamed "Amber Lake", "Comet Lake", and "Ice Lake". Ice Lake, based on the Sunny Cove microarchitecture, was produced on the 10 nm process and was limited to low-power mobile processors. Both Amber Lake and Comet Lake were based on a refined 14 nm node, with the latter being used for desktop and high-performance mobile products and the former used for low-power mobile products.

In September 2020, 11th-generation Core mobile processors, codenamed Tiger Lake, were launched.[172] Tiger Lake is based on the Willow Cove microarchitecture and a refined 10 nm node.[173] Intel later released 11th-generation Core desktop processors (codenamed "Rocket Lake"), fabricated using Intel's 14 nm process and based on the Cypress Cove microarchitecture,[174] on March 30, 2021.[175] It replaced Comet Lake desktop processors. All 11th-generation Core processors feature new integrated graphics based on the Intel Xe microarchitecture.[176]

Both desktop and mobile products were unified under a single process node with the release of 12th-generation Intel Core processors (codenamed "Alder Lake") in late 2021.[177][178] This generation will be fabricated using Intel's 7 nm process, called Intel 7, for both desktop and mobile processors, and is based on a hybrid architecture utilizing high-performance Golden Cove cores and high-efficiency Gracemont (Atom) cores.[177]
Meltdown, Spectre, and other security vulnerabilities
Main article: Transient execution CPU vulnerability

In early January 2018, it was reported that all Intel processors made since 1995[179][117] (besides Intel Itanium and pre-2013 Intel Atom) have been subject to two security flaws dubbed Meltdown and Spectre.[180][116]

The impact on performance resulting from software patches is "workload-dependent". Several procedures to help protect home computers and related devices from the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities have been published.[181][182][183][184] Spectre patches have been reported to significantly slow down performance, especially on older computers; on the newer 8th-generation Core platforms, benchmark performance drops of 2–14% have been measured.[126] Meltdown patches may also produce performance loss.[127][128][129] It is believed that "hundreds of millions" of systems could be affected by these flaws.[117][185]

On March 15, 2018, Intel reported that it will redesign its CPUs (performance losses to be determined) to protect against the Spectre security vulnerability, and expects to release the newly redesigned processors later in 2018.[124][125]

On May 3, 2018, eight additional Spectre-class flaws were reported. Intel reported that they are preparing new patches to mitigate these flaws.[186]

On August 14, 2018, Intel disclosed three additional chip flaws referred to as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). They reported that previously released microcode updates, along with new, pre-release microcode updates can be used to mitigate these flaws.[187][188]

On January 18, 2019, Intel disclosed three new vulnerabilities affecting all Intel CPUs, named "Fallout", "RIDL", and "ZombieLoad", allowing a program to read information recently written, read data in the line-fill buffers and load ports, and leak information from other processes and virtual machines.[189][190][191] Coffee Lake-series CPUs are even more vulnerable, due to hardware mitigations for Spectre.[citation needed]

On March 5, 2020, computer security experts reported another Intel chip security flaw, besides the Meltdown and Spectre flaws, with the systematic name CVE-2019-0090 (or "Intel CSME Bug").[120] This newly found flaw is not fixable with a firmware update, and affects nearly "all Intel chips released in the past five years".[121][122][123]
Use of Intel products by Apple Inc. (2005–2019)
Further information: Mac transition to Intel processors

On June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs, then CEO of Apple, announced that Apple would be transitioning the Macintosh from its long favored PowerPC architecture to the Intel x86 architecture because the future PowerPC road map was unable to satisfy Apple's needs.[66][192] This was seen as a win for Intel,[67] although an analyst called the move "risky" and "foolish", as Intel's current offerings at the time were considered to be behind those of AMD and IBM.[68] The first Mac computers containing Intel CPUs were announced on January 10, 2006, and Apple had its entire line of consumer Macs running on Intel processors by early August 2006. The Apple Xserve server was updated to Intel Xeon processors from November 2006 and was offered in a configuration similar to Apple's Mac Pro.[193]

Despite Apple's use of Intel products, relations between the two companies were strained at times.[194] Rumors of Apple switching from Intel processors to their own designs began circulating as early as 2011.[195] On June 22, 2020, during Apple's annual WWDC, Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, announced that it would be transitioning the company's entire Mac line from Intel CPUs to custom Apple-designed processors based on the Arm architecture over the course of the next two years. In the short term, this transition was estimated to have minimal effects on Intel, as Apple only accounted for 2% to 4% of its revenue. However, at the time it was believed that Apple's shift to its own chips might prompt other PC manufacturers to reassess their reliance on Intel and the x86 architecture.[133][134] By November 2020, Apple unveiled the M1, its processor custom-designed for the Mac.[196][197][198][199]
Solid-state drives (SSD)
See also: List of Intel SSDs
An Intel mSATA SSD

In 2008, Intel began shipping mainstream solid-state drives (SSDs) with up to 160 GB storage capacities.[200] As with their CPUs, Intel develops SSD chips using ever-smaller nanometer processes. These SSDs make use of industry standards such as NAND flash,[201] mSATA,[202] PCIe, and NVMe. In 2017, Intel introduced SSDs based on 3D XPoint technology under the Optane brand name.[203]

In 2021, SK Hynix acquired most of Intel's NAND memory business[204] for $7 billion, with a remaining transaction worth $2 billion expected in 2025.[205] Intel also discontinued its consumer Optane products in 2021.[206] In July 2022, Intel disclosed in its Q2 earnings report that it would cease future product development within its Optane business, which in turn effectively discontinued the development of 3D XPoint as a whole.[207]
Supercomputers

The Intel Scientific Computers division was founded in 1984 by Justin Rattner, to design and produce parallel computers based on Intel microprocessors connected in hypercube internetwork topology.[208] In 1992, the name was changed to the Intel Supercomputing Systems Division, and development of the iWarp architecture was also subsumed.[209] The division designed several supercomputer systems, including the Intel iPSC/1, iPSC/2, iPSC/860, Paragon and ASCI Red. In November 2014, Intel stated that it was planning to use optical fibers to improve networking within supercomputers.[210]
Fog computing

On November 19, 2015, Intel, alongside Arm, Dell, Cisco Systems, Microsoft, and Princeton University, founded the OpenFog Consortium, to promote interests and development in fog computing.[211] Intel's Chief Strategist for the IoT Strategy and Technology Office, Jeff Fedders, became the consortium's first president.[212]
Self-driving cars

Intel is one of the biggest stakeholders in the self-driving car industry, having joined the race in mid 2017[213] after joining forces with Mobileye.[214] The company is also one of the first in the sector to research consumer acceptance, after an AAA report quoted a 78% nonacceptance rate of the technology in the U.S.[215]

Safety levels of autonomous driving technology, the thought of abandoning control to a machine, and psychological comfort of passengers in such situations were the major discussion topics initially. The commuters also stated that they did not want to see everything the car was doing. This was primarily a referral to the auto-steering wheel with no one sitting in the driving seat. Intel also learned that voice control regulator is vital, and the interface between the humans and machine eases the discomfort condition, and brings some sense of control back.[216] It is important to mention that Intel included only 10 people in this study, which makes the study less credible.[215] In a video posted on YouTube,[217] Intel accepted this fact and called for further testing.
Programmable devices

Intel formed a new business unit called the Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) on completion of its Altera acquisition.[218] Intel has since sold Stratix, Arria, and Cyclone FPGAs. In 2019, Intel released Agilex FPGAs: chips aimed at data centers, 5G applications, and other uses.[219]

In October 2023, Intel announced it would be spinning off PSG into a separate company at the start of 2024, while maintaining majority ownership.[220]
Competition, antitrust and espionage
See also: AMD v. Intel

By the end of the 1990s, microprocessor performance had outstripped software demand for that CPU power.[citation needed] Aside from high-end server systems and software, whose demand dropped with the end of the "dot-com bubble",[221] consumer systems ran effectively on increasingly low-cost systems after 2000.

Intel's strategy was to develop processors with better performance in a short time, from the appearance of one to the other, as seen with the appearance of the Pentium II in May 1997, the Pentium III in February 1999, and the Pentium 4 in the fall of 2000, making the strategy ineffective since the consumer did not see the innovation as essential,[222] and leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors, notably AMD. This, in turn, lowered the profitability[citation needed] of the processor line and ended an era of unprecedented dominance of the PC hardware by Intel.[citation needed]

Intel's dominance in the x86 microprocessor market led to numerous charges of antitrust violations over the years, including FTC investigations in both the late 1980s and in 1999, and civil actions such as the 1997 suit by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and a patent suit by Intergraph. Intel's market dominance (at one time[when?] it controlled over 85% of the market for 32-bit x86 microprocessors) combined with Intel's own hardball legal tactics (such as its infamous 338 patent suit versus PC manufacturers)[223] made it an attractive target for litigation, culminating in Intel agreeing to pay AMD $1.25 billion and grant them a perpetual patent cross-license in 2009 as well as several anti-trust judgements in Europe, Korea, and Japan.[224]

A case of industrial espionage arose in 1995 that involved both Intel and AMD. Bill Gaede, an Argentine formerly employed both at AMD and at Intel's Arizona plant, was arrested for attempting in 1993 to sell the i486 and P5 Pentium designs to AMD and to certain foreign powers.[225] Gaede videotaped data from his computer screen at Intel and mailed it to AMD, which immediately alerted Intel and authorities, resulting in Gaede's arrest. Gaede was convicted and sentenced to 33 months in prison in June 1996.[226][227]
Corporate affairs
Leadership and corporate structure
Paul Otellini, Craig Barrett and Sean Maloney in 2006

Robert Noyce was Intel's CEO at its founding in 1968, followed by co-founder Gordon Moore in 1975. Andy Grove became the company's president in 1979 and added the CEO title in 1987 when Moore became chairman. In 1998, Grove succeeded Moore as chairman, and Craig Barrett, already company president, took over. On May 18, 2005, Barrett handed the reins of the company over to Paul Otellini, who had been the company president and COO and who was responsible for Intel's design win in the original IBM PC. The board of directors elected Otellini as president and CEO, and Barrett replaced Grove as Chairman of the Board. Grove stepped down as chairman but is retained as a special adviser. In May 2009, Barrett stepped down as chairman of the board and was succeeded by Jane Shaw. In May 2012, Intel vice chairman Andy Bryant, who had held the posts of CFO (1994) and Chief Administrative Officer (2007) at Intel, succeeded Shaw as executive chairman.[228]

In November 2012, president and CEO Paul Otellini announced that he would step down in May 2013 at the age of 62, three years before the company's mandatory retirement age. During a six-month transition period, Intel's board of directors commenced a search process for the next CEO, in which it considered both internal managers and external candidates such as Sanjay Jha and Patrick Gelsinger.[229] Financial results revealed that, under Otellini, Intel's revenue increased by 55.8% (US$34.2 to 53.3 billion), while its net income increased by 46.7% (US$7.5 billion to 11 billion),[230] proving that his illegal business practices were more profitable than the fines levied against the company as punishment for employing them.

On May 2, 2013, Executive Vice President and COO Brian Krzanich was elected as Intel's sixth CEO,[231] a selection that became effective on May 16, 2013, at the company's annual meeting. Reportedly, the board concluded that an insider could proceed with the role and exert an impact more quickly, without the need to learn Intel's processes, and Krzanich was selected on such a basis.[232] Intel's software head Renée James was selected as president of the company, a role that is second to the CEO position.[233]

As of May 2013, Intel's board of directors consists of Andy Bryant, John Donahoe, Frank Yeary, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky, Susan Decker, Reed Hundt, Paul Otellini, James Plummer, David Pottruck, and David Yoffie and Creative director will.i.am. The board was described by former Financial Times journalist Tom Foremski as "an exemplary example of corporate governance of the highest order" and received a rating of ten from GovernanceMetrics International, a form of recognition that has only been awarded to twenty-one other corporate boards worldwide.[234]

On June 21, 2018, Intel announced the resignation of Brian Krzanich as CEO, with the exposure of a relationship he had with an employee. Bob Swan was named interim CEO, as the Board began a search for a permanent CEO.

On January 31, 2019, Swan transitioned from his role as CFO and interim CEO and was named by the Board as the seventh CEO to lead the company.[235]

On January 13, 2021, Intel announced that Swan would be replaced as CEO by Pat Gelsinger, effective February 15. Gelsinger is a former Intel chief technology officer who had previously been head of VMWare.[236]

In October 2023, Intel announced it would be spinning off its Programmable Solutions Group business unit into a separate company at the start of 2024, while maintaining majority ownership and intending to seek an IPO within three years to raise funds.[220][237]

Employment
Intel microprocessor facility in Costa Rica was responsible in 2006 for 20% of Costa Rican exports and 4.9% of the country's GDP.[241]

Intel has a mandatory retirement policy for its CEOs when they reach age 65. Andy Grove retired at 62, while both Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore retired at 58. Grove retired as chairman and as a member of the board of directors in 2005 at age 68.

Intel's headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California, and the company has operations around the world. Its largest workforce concentration anywhere is in Washington County, Oregon[242] (in the Portland metropolitan area's "Silicon Forest"), with 18,600 employees at several facilities.[243] Outside the United States, the company has facilities in China, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Israel, Ireland, India, Russia, Argentina and Vietnam, in 63 countries and regions internationally. In March 2022, because of international sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War, Intel stopped supplying Russian market.[244] In the U.S. Intel employs significant numbers of people in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Washington and Utah. In Oregon, Intel is the state's largest private employer.[243][245] The company is the largest industrial employer in New Mexico while in Arizona the company has 12,000 employees as of January 2020.[246]

Intel invests heavily in research in China and about 100 researchers – or 10% of the total number of researchers from Intel – are located in Beijing.[247]

In 2011, the Israeli government offered Intel $290 million to expand in the country. As a condition, Intel would employ 1,500 more workers in Kiryat Gat and between 600 and 1000 workers in the north.[248]

In January 2014, it was reported that Intel would cut about 5,000 jobs from its workforce of 107,000. The announcement was made a day after it reported earnings that missed analyst targets.[249]

In March 2014, it was reported that Intel would embark upon a $6 billion plan to expand its activities in Israel. The plan calls for continued investment in existing and new Intel plants until 2030. As of 2014, Intel employs 10,000 workers at four development centers and two production plants in Israel.[250]

Due to declining PC sales, in 2016 Intel cut 12,000 jobs.[251] In 2021, Intel reversed course under new CEO Pat Gelsinger and started hiring thousands of engineers.[252]
Diversity

Intel has a Diversity Initiative, including employee diversity groups as well as supplier diversity programs.[253] Like many companies with employee diversity groups, they include groups based on race and nationality as well as sexual identity and religion. In 1994, Intel sanctioned one of the earliest corporate Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender employee groups,[254] and supports a Muslim employees group,[255] a Jewish employees group,[256] and a Bible-based Christian group.[257][258]

Intel has received a 100% rating on numerous Corporate Equality Indices released by the Human Rights Campaign including the first one released in 2002. In addition, the company is frequently named one of the 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers by Working Mother magazine.

In January 2015, Intel announced the investment of $300 million over the next five years to enhance gender and racial diversity in their own company as well as the technology industry as a whole.[259][260][261][262][263]

In February 2016, Intel released its Global Diversity & Inclusion 2015 Annual Report.[264] The male-female mix of US employees was reported as 75.2% men and 24.8% women. For US employees in technical roles, the mix was reported as 79.8% male and 20.1% female.[264] NPR reports that Intel is facing a retention problem (particularly for African Americans), not just a pipeline problem.[265]
Economic impact in Oregon in 2009

In 2011, ECONorthwest conducted an economic impact analysis of Intel's economic contribution to the state of Oregon. The report found that in 2009 "the total economic impacts attributed to Intel's operations, capital spending, contributions and taxes amounted to almost $14.6 billion in activity, including $4.3 billion in personal income and 59,990 jobs".[266] Through multiplier effects, every 10 Intel jobs supported, on average, was found to create 31 jobs in other sectors of the economy.[267]
Intel Israel

Intel has been operating in the State of Israel since Dov Frohman founded the Israeli branch of the company in 1974 in a small office in Haifa. Intel Israel currently has development centers in Haifa, Jerusalem and Petah Tikva, and has a manufacturing plant in the Kiryat Gat industrial park that develops and manufactures microprocessors and communications products. Intel employed about 10,000 employees in Israel in 2013. Maxine Fesberg has been the CEO of Intel Israel since 2007 and the Vice President of Intel Global. In December 2016, Fesberg announced her resignation, her position of chief executive officer (CEO) has been filled by Yaniv Gerti since January 2017.
Key acquisitions and investments (2010–present)
Main article: List of mergers and acquisitions by Intel

In 2010, Intel purchased McAfee, a manufacturer of computer security technology, for $7.68 billion.[268] As a condition for regulatory approval of the transaction, Intel agreed to provide rival security firms with all necessary information that would allow their products to use Intel's chips and personal computers.[269] After the acquisition, Intel had about 90,000 employees, including about 12,000 software engineers.[270] In September 2016, Intel sold a majority stake in its computer-security unit to TPG Capital, reversing the five-year-old McAfee acquisition.[271]

In August 2010, Intel and Infineon Technologies announced that Intel would acquire Infineon's Wireless Solutions business.[272] Intel planned to use Infineon's technology in laptops, smart phones, netbooks, tablets and embedded computers in consumer products, eventually integrating its wireless modem into Intel's silicon chips.[273]

In February 2022, Intel agreed to acquire Israeli chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 billion.[296][297] In August 2023, Intel terminated the acquisition as it failed to obtain approval from Chinese regulators within the 18-month transaction deadline.[298][299]

In May 2022, Intel announced that they have acquired Finnish graphics technology firm Siru innovations. The firm founded by ex-AMD Qualcomm mobile GPU engineers, is focused on developing software and silicon building blocks for GPU's made by other companies and is set to join Intel's fledgling Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group.[300]

In May 2022, it was announced that Ericsson and Intel are pooling research and development to create high-performing cloud RAN solutions.[buzzword] The organisations have pooled to launch a tech hub in California, U.S. The hub focuses on the benefits that Ericsson Cloud RAN and Intel technology can bring to: improving energy efficiency and network performance, reducing time to market, and monetizing new business opportunities such as enterprise applications.[301]
Ultrabook fund (2011)

In 2011, Intel Capital announced a new fund to support startups working on technologies in line with the company's concept for next-generation notebooks.[302] The company is setting aside a $300 million fund to be spent over the next three to four years in areas related to ultrabooks.[302] Intel announced the ultrabook concept at Computex in 2011. The ultrabook is defined as a thin (less than 0.8 inches [~2 cm] thick[303]) notebook that utilizes Intel processors[303] and also incorporates tablet features such as a touch screen and long battery life.[302][303]

At the Intel Developers Forum in 2011, four Taiwan ODMs showed prototype ultrabooks that used Intel's Ivy Bridge chips.[304] Intel plans to improve power consumption of its chips for ultrabooks, like new Ivy Bridge processors in 2013, which will only have 10W default thermal design power.[305]

Intel's goal for Ultrabook's price is below $1000;[303] however, according to two presidents from Acer and Compaq, this goal will not be achieved if Intel does not lower the price of its chips.[306]
Open source support

Intel has a significant participation in the open source communities since 1999.[307][self-published source] For example, in 2006 Intel released MIT-licensed X.org drivers for their integrated graphic cards of the i965 family of chipsets. Intel released FreeBSD drivers for some networking cards,[308] available under a BSD-compatible license,[309] which were also ported to OpenBSD.[309] Binary firmware files for non-wireless Ethernet devices were also released under a BSD licence allowing free redistribution.[310] Intel ran the Moblin project until April 23, 2009, when they handed the project over to the Linux Foundation. Intel also runs the LessWatts.org campaigns.[311]

However, after the release of the wireless products called Intel Pro/Wireless 2100, 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG and 3945ABG in 2005, Intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate.[312] As a result of this, Intel became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community. Linspire-Linux creator Michael Robertson outlined the difficult position that Intel was in releasing to open source, as Intel did not want to upset their large customer Microsoft.[313] Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD also claimed that Intel is being "an Open Source fraud" after an Intel employee presented a distorted view of the situation at an open source conference.[314] In spite of the significant negative attention Intel received as a result of the wireless dealings, the binary firmware still has not gained a license compatible with free software principles.[315]

Intel has also supported other open source projects such as Blender[316] and Open 3D Engine.[317]

2022-current

In its history, Intel has had three logos. The first Intel logo featured the company's name stylized in all lowercase, with the letter e dropped below the other letters. The second logo was inspired by the "Intel Inside" campaign, featuring a swirl around the Intel brand name.[318]

The third logo, introduced in 2020, was inspired by the previous logos. It removes the swirl as well as the classic blue color in almost all parts of the logo, except for the dot in the "i".[319]
Intel Inside
The "Intel Inside" logo used from 1991 to 2003
The "Intel Inside" logo used from 2003 to 2006
The "Intel Inside" logo used from 2006 to 2014, continuously underwent a minor font and shade of color modification to be used until 2020
The current "Intel Inside" badge has been used since 2020. It is also adopted as the umbrella branding to promote Intel's low-end processors from 2023.

Intel has become one of the world's most recognizable computer brands following its long-running Intel Inside campaign. The idea for "Intel Inside" came out of a meeting between Intel and one of the major computer resellers, MicroAge.[320]

In the late 1980s, Intel's market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as AMD, Zilog, and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers. This was because, by using cheaper processors, manufacturers could make cheaper computers and gain more market share in an increasingly price-sensitive market. In 1989, Intel's Dennis Carter visited MicroAge's headquarters in Tempe, Arizona, to meet with MicroAge's VP of Marketing, Ron Mion. MicroAge had become one of the largest distributors of Compaq, IBM, HP, and others and thus was a primary – although indirect – driver of demand for microprocessors. Intel wanted MicroAge to petition its computer suppliers to favor Intel chips. However, Mion felt that the marketplace should decide which processors they wanted. Intel's counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate PC buyers on why Intel microprocessors were worth paying more for.[320]

Mion felt that the public did not really need to fully understand why Intel chips were better, they just needed to feel they were better. So Mion proposed a market test. Intel would pay for a MicroAge billboard somewhere saying, "If you're buying a personal computer, make sure it has Intel inside." In turn, MicroAge would put "Intel Inside" stickers on the Intel-based computers in their stores in that area. To make the test easier to monitor, Mion decided to do the test in Boulder, Colorado, where it had a single store. Virtually overnight, the sales of personal computers in that store dramatically shifted to Intel-based PCs. Intel very quickly adopted "Intel Inside" as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide.[320] As is often the case with computer lore, other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved. "Intel Inside" has not escaped that tendency and there are other "explanations" that had been floating around.

Intel's branding campaign started with "The Computer Inside" tagline in 1990 in the U.S. and Europe. The Japan chapter of Intel proposed an "Intel in it" tagline and kicked off the Japanese campaign by hosting EKI-KON (meaning "Station Concert" in Japanese) at the Tokyo railway station dome on Christmas Day, December 25, 1990. Several months later, "The Computer Inside" incorporated the Japan idea to become "Intel Inside" which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in 1991, by Intel marketing manager Dennis Carter.[321] A case study, "Inside Intel Inside", was put together by Harvard Business School.[322] The five-note jingle was introduced in 1994 and by its tenth anniversary was being heard in 130 countries around the world. The initial branding agency for the "Intel Inside" campaign was DahlinSmithWhite Advertising of Salt Lake City.[323] The Intel swirl logo was the work of DahlinSmithWhite art director Steve Grigg under the direction of Intel president and CEO Andy Grove.[citation needed]

The Intel Inside advertising campaign sought public brand loyalty and awareness of Intel processors in consumer computers.[324] Intel paid some of the advertiser's costs for an ad that used the Intel Inside logo and xylo-marimba jingle.[325]

In 2008, Intel planned to shift the emphasis of its Intel Inside campaign from traditional media such as television and print to newer media such as the Internet.[326] Intel required that a minimum of 35% of the money it provided to the companies in its co-op program be used for online marketing.[326] The Intel 2010 annual financial report indicated that $1.8 billion (6% of the gross margin and nearly 16% of the total net income) was allocated to all advertising with Intel Inside being part of that.[327]

The D♭–D♭–G♭–D♭–A♭ xylophone/marimba jingle, known as the "Intel bong",[328] used in Intel advertising was produced by Musikvergnuegen and written by Walter Werzowa, once a member of the Austrian 1980s sampling band Edelweiss.[329] The Intel jingle was made in 1994 to coincide with the launch of the Pentium. It was modified in 1999 to coincide with the launch of the Pentium III, although it overlapped with the 1994 version which was phased out in 2004. Advertisements for products featuring Intel processors with prominent MMX branding featured a version of the jingle with an embellishment (shining sound) after the final note.

The jingle was remade a second time in 2004 to coincide with the new logo change.[citation needed] Again, it overlapped with the 1999 version and was not mainstreamed until the launch of the Core processors in 2006, with the melody unchanged.

Another remake of the jingle debuted with Intel's new visual identity.[330] The company has made use of numerous variants since its rebranding in 2020 (while retaining the mainstream 2006 version).
Processor naming strategy
The 2020 Intel badge representing the Core i7 brand combined with the vPRO platform marketing term

In 2006, Intel expanded its promotion of open specification platforms beyond Centrino, to include the Viiv media center PC and the business desktop Intel vPro.

In mid-January 2006, Intel announced that they were dropping the long running Pentium name from their processors. The Pentium name was first used to refer to the P5 core Intel processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers, so competitors could not just call their processor the same name, as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors (both of which had copies manufactured by IBM and AMD). They phased out the Pentium names from mobile processors first, when the new Yonah chips, branded Core Solo and Core Duo, were released. The desktop processors changed when the Core 2 line of processors were released. By 2009, Intel was using a good–better–best strategy with Celeron being good, Pentium better, and the Intel Core family representing the best the company has to offer.[331]

According to spokesman Bill Calder, Intel has maintained only the Celeron brand, the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses. Since late 2009, Intel's mainstream processors have been called Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9 in order of performance from lowest to highest. The 1st-generation Core products carry a 3 digit name, such as i5-750, and the 2nd-generation products carry a 4 digit name, such as the i5-2500, and from 10th-generation onwards, Intel processors will have a 5 digit name, such as i9-10900K for desktop. In all cases, a 'K' at the end of it shows that it is an unlocked processor, enabling additional overclocking abilities (for instance, 2500K). vPro products will carry the Intel Core i7 vPro processor or the Intel Core i5 vPro processor name.[332] In October 2011, Intel started to sell its Core i7-2700K "Sandy Bridge" chip to customers worldwide.[333]

Since 2010, "Centrino" is only being applied to Intel's WiMAX and Wi-Fi technologies.[332]

In 2022, Intel announced that they are dropping the Pentium and Celeron naming schemes for their desktop and laptop entry level processors. The "Intel Processor" branding will be replacing the old Pentium and Celeron naming schemes starting in 2023.[334][335]

In 2023, Intel announced that they will be dropping the 'i' in their future processor markings. For example, products such as Core i9, will now be called Core 9. Ultra will be added to the endings of processors that are in the higher end, such as Core Ultra 9.[336][337]
Typography

Neo Sans Intel is a customized version of Neo Sans based on the Neo Sans and Neo Tech, designed by Sebastian Lester in 2004.[338] It was introduced alongside Intel's rebranding in 2006. Previously, Intel used Helvetica as its standard typeface in corporate marketing.

Intel Clear is a global font announced in 2014 designed for to be used across all communications.[339][340] The font family was designed by Red Peek Branding and Dalton Maag[341] Initially available in Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts, it replaced Neo Sans Intel as the company's corporate typeface.[342][343] Intel Clear Hebrew, Intel Clear Arabic were added by Dalton Maag Ltd.[344] Neo Sans Intel remained in logo and to mark processor type and socket on the packaging of Intel's processors.

In 2020, as part of a new visual identity, a new typeface, Intel One, was designed. It replaced Intel Clear as the font used by the company in most of its branding, however, it is used alongside Intel Clear typeface.[345] In logo, it replaced Neo Sans Intel typeface. However, it is still used to mark processor type and socket on the packaging of Intel's processors.
Intel Brand Book

It is a book produced by Red Peak Branding as part of new brand identity campaign, celebrating Intel's achievements while setting the new standard for what Intel looks, feels and sounds like.[346]
Charity
Paddington Bear statue in London designed by Intel, auctioned for the NSPCC

In November 2014, Intel designed a Paddington Bear statue—themed "Little Bear Blue"—one of fifty statues created by various celebrities and companies which were located around London.[347] Created prior to the release of the film Paddington, the Intel designed statue was located outside Framestore in Chancery Lane, London, a British visual-effects company which uses Intel technology for films including Paddington.[348] The statues were then auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).[347][349]
Litigations and regulatory disputes
Patent infringement litigation (2006–2007)

In October 2006, a Transmeta lawsuit was filed against Intel for patent infringement on computer architecture and power efficiency technologies.[350] The lawsuit was settled in October 2007, with Intel agreeing to pay US$150 million initially and US$20 million per year for the next five years. Both companies agreed to drop lawsuits against each other, while Intel was granted a perpetual non-exclusive license to use current and future patented Transmeta technologies in its chips for 10 years.[351]
Antitrust allegations and litigation (2005–2023)

See also: AMD v. Intel

In September 2005, Intel filed a response to an AMD lawsuit,[352] disputing AMD's claims, and claiming that Intel's business practices are fair and lawful. In a rebuttal, Intel deconstructed AMD's offensive strategy and argued that AMD struggled largely as a result of its own bad business decisions, including underinvest

chip foundries.[353] Legal analysts predicted the lawsuit would drag on for a number of years, since Intel's initial response indicated its unwillingness to settle with AMD.[354][355] In 2008, a court date was finally set.[356][357]

On November 4, 2009, New York's attorney general filed an antitrust lawsuit against Intel Corp, claiming the company used "illegal threats and collusion" to dominate the market for computer microprocessors.

On November 12, 2009, AMD agreed to drop the antitrust lawsuit against Intel in exchange for $1.25 billion.[357] A joint press release published by the two chip makers stated "While the relationship between the two companies has been difficult in the past, this agreement ends the legal disputes and enables the companies to focus all of our efforts on product innovation and development."[358][359]

An antitrust lawsuit[360] and a class-action suit relating to cold calling employees of other companies has been settled.[361]
Allegations by Japan Fair Trade Commission (2005)

In 2005, the local Fair Trade Commission found that Intel violated the Japanese Antimonopoly Act. The commission ordered Intel to eliminate discounts that had discriminated against AMD. To avoid a trial, Intel agreed to comply with the order.[362][363][364][365]
Allegations by regulators in South Korea (2007)

In September 2007, South Korean regulators accused Intel of breaking antitrust law. The investigation began in February 2006, when officials raided Intel's South Korean offices. The company risked a penalty of up to 3% of its annual sales if found guilty.[366] In June 2008, the Fair Trade Commission ordered Intel to pay a fine of US$25.5 million for taking advantage of its dominant position to offer incentives to major Korean PC manufacturers on the condition of not buying products from AMD.[367]
Allegations by regulators in the United States (2008–2010)

New York started an investigation of Intel in January 2008 on whether the company violated antitrust laws in pricing and sales of its microprocessors.[368] In June 2008, the Federal Trade Commission also began an antitrust investigation of the case.[369] In December 2009, the FTC announced it would initiate an administrative proceeding against Intel in September 2010.[370][371][372][373]

In November 2009, following a two-year investigation, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sued Intel, accusing them of bribery and coercion, claiming that Intel bribed computer makers to buy more of their chips than those of their rivals and threatened to withdraw these payments if the computer makers were perceived as working too closely with its competitors. Intel has denied these claims.[374]

On July 22, 2010, Dell agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay $100 million in penalties resulting from charges that Dell did not accurately disclose accounting information to investors. In particular, the SEC charged that from 2002 to 2006, Dell had an agreement with Intel to receive rebates in exchange for not using chips manufactured by AMD. These substantial rebates were not disclosed to investors, but were used to help meet investor expectations regarding the company's financial performance; "These exclusivity payments grew from 10% of Dell's operating income in FY 2003 to 38% in FY 2006, and peaked at 76% in the first quarter of FY 2007."[375] Dell eventually did adopt AMD as a secondary supplier in 2006, and Intel subsequently stopped their rebates, causing Dell's financial performance to fall.[376][377][378]
Allegations by the European Union (2007–2023)

In July 2007, the European Commission accused Intel of anti-competitive practices, mostly against AMD.[379] The allegations, going back to 2003, include giving preferential prices to computer makers buying most or all of their chips from Intel, paying computer makers to delay or cancel the launch of products using AMD chips, and providing chips at below standard cost to governments and educational institutions.[380] Intel responded that the allegations were unfounded and instead qualified its market behavior as consumer-friendly.[380] General counsel Bruce Sewell responded that the commission had misunderstood some factual assumptions regarding pricing and manufacturing costs.[381]

In February 2008, Intel announced that its office in Munich had been raided by European Union regulators. Intel reported that it was cooperating with investigators.[382] Intel faced a fine of up to 10% of its annual revenue if found guilty of stifling competition.[383] AMD subsequently launched a website promoting these allegations.[384][385] In June 2008, the EU filed new charges against Intel.[386] In May 2009, the EU found that Intel had engaged in anti-competitive practices and subsequently fined Intel €1.06 billion (US$1.44 billion), a record amount. Intel was found to have paid companies, including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC,[387] to exclusively use Intel chips in their products, and therefore harmed other, less successful companies including AMD.[387][388][389] The European Commission said that Intel had deliberately acted to keep competitors out of the computer chip market and in doing so had made a "serious and sustained violation of the EU's antitrust rules".[387] In addition to the fine, Intel was ordered by the commission to immediately cease all illegal practices.[387] Intel has said that they will appeal against the commission's verdict. In June 2014, the General Court, which sits below the European Court of Justice, rejected the appeal.[387]

In 2022 the €1.06 billion fine was dropped, but was successively re-imposed in September 2023 as a €376.36 million fine.[390]
Corporate responsibility record

Intel has been accused by some residents of Rio Rancho, New Mexico of allowing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to be released in excess of their pollution permit. One resident claimed that a release of 1.4 tons of carbon tetrachloride was measured from one acid scrubber during the fourth quarter of 2003 but an emission factor allowed Intel to report no carbon tetrachloride emissions for all of 2003.[391]

Another resident alleges that Intel was responsible for the release of other VOCs from their Rio Rancho site and that a necropsy of lung tissue from two deceased dogs in the area indicated trace amounts of toluene, hexane, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers,[392] all of which are solvents used in industrial settings but also commonly found in gasoline, retail paint thinners and retail solvents. During a sub-committee meeting of the New Mexico Environment Improvement Board, a resident claimed that Intel's own reports documented more than 1,580 pounds (720 kg) of VOCs were released in June and July 2006.[393]

Intel's environmental performance is published annually in their corporate responsibility report.[394]
Conflict-free production

In 2009, Intel announced that it planned to undertake an effort to remove conflict resources—materials sourced from mines whose profits are used to fund armed militant groups, particularly within the Democratic Republic of the Congo—from its supply chain. Intel sought conflict-free sources of the precious metals common to electronics from within the country, using a system of first- and third-party audits, as well as input from the Enough Project and other organizations. During a keynote address at Consumer Electronics Show 2014, Intel CEO at the time, Brian Krzanich, announced that the company's microprocessors would henceforth be conflict free. In 2016, Intel stated that it had expected its entire supply chain to be conflict-free by the end of the year.[395][396][397]

In its 2012 rankings on the progress of consumer electronics companies relating to conflict minerals, the Enough Project rated Intel the best of 24 companies, calling it a "Pioneer of progress".[398] In 2014, chief executive Brian Krzanich urged the rest of the industry to follow Intel's lead by also shunning conflict minerals.[399]
Age discrimination complaints

Intel has faced complaints of age discrimination in firing and layoffs. Intel was sued in 1993 by nine former employees, over allegations that they were laid off because they were over the age of 40.[400]

A group called FACE Intel (Former and Current Employees of Intel) claims that Intel weeds out older employees. FACE Intel claims that more than 90% of people who have been laid off or fired from Intel are over the age of 40. Upside magazine requested data from Intel breaking out its hiring and firing by age, but the company declined to provide any.[401] Intel has denied that age plays any role in Intel's employment practices.[402] FACE Intel was founded by Ken Hamidi, who was fired from Intel in 1995 at the age of 47.[401] Hamidi was blocked in a 1999 court decision from using Intel's email system to distribute criticism of the company to employees,[403] which overturned in 2003 in Intel Corp. v. Hamidi.
Tax dispute in India

In August 2016, Indian officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) parked garbage trucks on Intel's campus and threatened to dump them for evading payment of property taxes between 2007 and 2008, to the tune of ₹340 million (US$4.3 million). Intel had reportedly been paying taxes as a non-air-conditioned office, when the campus in fact had central air conditioning. Other factors, such as land acquisition and construction improvements, added to the tax burden. Previously, Intel had appealed the demand in the Karnataka high court in July, during which the court ordered Intel to pay BBMP half the owed amount of ₹170 million (US$2.1 million) plus arrears by August 28 of that year.[404][405]

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational corporation and semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets.

AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors, graphics processors, and FPGAs for servers, workstations, personal computers, and embedded system applications. The company has also expanded into new markets, such as the data center, gaming, and high-performance computing[2] markets. AMD's processors are used in a wide range of computing devices, including personal computers, servers, laptops, and gaming consoles. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009.

AMD was founded in 1969 by Jerry Sanders and a group of other technology professionals. The company's early products were primarily memory chips and other components for computers. In 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market, competing with Intel, its main rival in the industry. In the early 2000s, it experienced significant growth and success, thanks in part to its strong position in the PC market and the success of its Athlon and Opteron processors. However, the company faced challenges in the late 2000s and early 2010s, as it struggled to keep up with Intel in the race to produce faster and more powerful processors.

In the late 2010s, AMD regained market share due to the success of its Ryzen processors which were considerably more competitive with Intel microprocessors in terms of their performance in business applications, including cloud applications.[citation needed]

Foundational years

Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated by Jerry Sanders, along with seven of his colleagues from Fairchild Semiconductor, on May 1, 1969.[3][4] Sanders, an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at Fairchild, had, like many Fairchild executives, grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support, opportunity, and flexibility within the company. He later decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company,[5] following the footsteps of Robert Noyce (developer of the first silicon integrated circuit at Fairchild in 1959)[6] and Gordon Moore, who together founded the semiconductor company Intel in July 1968.[7]

In September 1969, AMD moved from its temporary location in Santa Clara to Sunnyvale, California.[8] To immediately secure a customer base, AMD initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by Fairchild and National Semiconductor.[9][10] AMD first focused on producing logic chips.[11] The company guaranteed quality control to United States Military Standard, an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers, the telecommunications industry, and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid.[9][12][13][14]

In November 1969, the company manufactured its first product: the Am9300, a 4-bit MSI shift register, which began selling in 1970.[14][15] Also in 1970, AMD produced its first proprietary product, the Am2501 logic counter, which was highly successful.[16][17] Its bestselling product in 1971 was the Am2505, the fastest multiplier available.[16][18]

In 1971, AMD entered the RAM chip market, beginning with the Am3101, a 64-bit bipolar RAM.[18][19] That year AMD also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits, and by year-end the company's total annual sales reached US$4.6 million.[16][20]

AMD went public in September 1972.[9][21][22] The company was a second source for Intel MOS/LSI circuits by 1973, with products such as Am14/1506 and Am14/1507, dual 100-bit dynamic shift registers.[23][24] By 1975, AMD was producing 212 products – of which 49 were proprietary, including the Am9102 (a static N-channel 1024-bit RAM)[25] and three low-power Schottky MSI circuits: Am25LS07, Am25LS08, and Am25LS09.[26]

Intel had created the first microprocessor, its 4-bit 4004, in 1971.[27][28] By 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market with the Am9080, a reverse-engineered clone of the Intel 8080,[29][30][31] and the Am2900 bit-slice microprocessor family.[30] When Intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in 1976, it entered into a cross-licensing agreement with AMD, which was granted a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals, effective October 1976.[26][32][33][34][35]

In 1977, AMD entered into a joint venture with Siemens, a German engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the American market.[36] Siemens purchased 20% of AMD's stock, giving the company an infusion of cash to increase its product lines.[36][37][38] The two companies also jointly established Advanced Micro Computers (AMC), located in Silicon Valley and in Germany, allowing AMD to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field,[36][39][40][41] in particular based on AMD's second-source Zilog Z8000 microprocessors.[42][43] When the two companies' vision for Advanced Micro Computers diverged, AMD bought out Siemens' stake in the American division in 1979.[44][45] AMD closed Advanced Micro Computers in late 1981 after switching focus to manufacturing second-source Intel x86 microprocessors.[42][46][47]

Total sales in fiscal year 1978 topped $100 million,[39] and in 1979, AMD debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.[17] In 1979, production also began on AMD's new semiconductor fabrication plant in Austin, Texas;[17] the company already had overseas assembly facilities in Penang and Manila,[48] and began construction on a fabrication plant in San Antonio in 1981.[49] In 1980, AMD began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications, an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation.[50]
Intel partnership

Intel had introduced the first x86 microprocessors in 1978.[51] In 1981, IBM created its PC, and wanted Intel's x86 processors, but only under the condition that Intel also provide a second-source manufacturer for its patented x86 microprocessors.[12] Intel and AMD entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement, first signed in October 1981[46][52] and formally executed in February 1982.[35] The terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become a second-source manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other; that is, each party could "earn" the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the other, if agreed to, by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity. The technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the developing company.[34] The 1982 agreement also extended the 1976 AMD–Intel cross-licensing agreement through 1995.[34][35] The agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements, and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one year's notice.[34] The main result of the 1982 agreement was that AMD became a second-source manufacturer of Intel's x86 microprocessors and related chips, and Intel provided AMD with database tapes for its 8086, 80186, and 80286 chips.[35] However, in the event of a bankruptcy or takeover of AMD, the cross-licensing agreement would be effectively canceled.[53]

Beginning in 1982, AMD began volume-producing second-source Intel-licensed 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 processors, and by 1984, its own Am286 clone of Intel's 80286 processor, for the rapidly growing market of IBM PCs and IBM clones.[12][54] It also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips.[55]

The company continued to spend greatly on research and development,[56] and created the world's first 512K EPROM in 1984.[57] That year, AMD was listed in the book The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America,[49][58] and later made the Fortune 500 list for the first time in 1985.[59][60]

By mid-1985, the microchip market experienced a severe downturn, mainly due to long-term aggressive trade practices (dumping) from Japan, but also due to a crowded and non-innovative chip market in the United States.[61] AMD rode out the mid-1980s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing,[62] devising the Liberty Chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chipset per week for 52 weeks in fiscal year 1986,[49][63] and by heavily lobbying the U.S. government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory Japanese pricing.[64] During this time, AMD withdrew from the DRAM market,[65] and made some headway into the CMOS market, which it had lagged in entering, having focused instead on bipolar chips.[66]

AMD had some success in the mid-1980s with the AMD7910 and AMD7911 "World Chip" FSK modem, one of the first multi-standard devices that covered both Bell and CCITT tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex.[67] Beginning in 1986, AMD embraced the perceived shift toward RISC with their own AMD Am29000 (29k) processor;[68] the 29k survived as an embedded processor.[69][70] The company also increased its EPROM memory market share in the late 1980s.[71] Throughout the 1980s, AMD was a second-source supplier of Intel x86 processors. In 1991, it introduced its own 386-compatible Am386, an AMD-designed chip. Creating its own chips, AMD began to compete directly with Intel.[72]

AMD had a large, successful flash memory business, even during the dotcom bust.[73] In 2003, to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow, which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from Intel, AMD spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into Spansion, a joint venture with Fujitsu, which had been co-manufacturing flash memory with AMD since 1993.[74][75] In December 2005, AMD divested itself of Spansion to focus on the microprocessor market, and Spansion went public in an IPO.[76]
2006–present

On July 24, 2006, AMD announced its acquisition of the Canadian 3D graphics card company ATI Technologies. AMD paid $4.3 billion and 58 million shares of its capital stock, for a total of approximately $5.4 billion. The transaction was completed on October 25, 2006.[77] On August 30, 2010, AMD announced that it would retire the ATI brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the AMD brand name.[78][79]

In October 2008, AMD announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of GlobalFoundries Inc., a multibillion-dollar joint venture with Advanced Technology Investment Co., an investment company formed by the government of Abu Dhabi. The partnership and spin-off gave AMD an infusion of cash and allowed it to focus solely on chip design.[80] To assure the Abu Dhabi investors of the new venture's success, AMD's CEO Hector Ruiz stepped down in July 2008, while remaining executive chairman, in preparation for becoming chairman of GlobalFoundries in March 2009.[81][82] President and COO Dirk Meyer became AMD's CEO.[83] Recessionary losses necessitated AMD cutting 1,100 jobs in 2009.[84]

In August 2011, AMD announced that former Lenovo executive Rory Read would be joining the company as CEO, replacing Meyer.[85] In November 2011, AMD announced plans to lay off more than 10% (1,400) of its employees from across all divisions worldwide.[86] In October 2012, it announced plans to lay off an additional 15% of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue.[87]

AMD acquired the low-power server manufacturer SeaMicro in early 2012, with an eye to bringing out an Arm64 server chip.[88]

On October 8, 2014, AMD announced that Rory Read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer.[89] He was succeeded by Lisa Su, a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since June.[90]

On October 16, 2014, AMD announced a new restructuring plan along with its Q3 results. Effective July 1, 2014, AMD reorganized into two business groups: Computing and Graphics, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. As part of this restructuring, AMD announced that 7% of its global workforce would be laid off by the end of 2014.[91]

After the GlobalFoundries spin-off and subsequent layoffs, AMD was left with significant vacant space at 1 AMD Place, its aging Sunnyvale headquarters office complex. In August 2016, AMD's 47 years in Sunnyvale came to a close when it signed a lease with the Irvine Company for a new 220,000 sq. ft. headquarters building in Santa Clara.[92] AMD's new location at Santa Clara Square faces the headquarters of archrival Intel across the Bayshore Freeway and San Tomas Aquino Creek. Around the same time, AMD also agreed to sell 1 AMD Place to the Irvine Company.[93] In April 2019, the Irvine Company secured approval from the Sunnyvale City Council of its plans to demolish 1 AMD Place and redevelop the entire 32-acre site into townhomes and apartments.[93]

In October 2020, AMD announced that it was acquiring Xilinx in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition was completed in February 2022, with an estimated acquisition price of $50 billion.[94][95]

In October 2023, AMD acquired an open-source AI software provider, Nod.ai, to bolster its AI software ecosystem.[96][97]

In March 2024 rally in semiconductor stocks pushed AMD valuation above $300B for the first time in history.[98] 

IBM PC and the x86 architecture
Main articles: Am286, Am386, Am486, and Am5x86

In February 1982, AMD signed a contract with Intel, becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of 8086 and 8088 processors. IBM wanted to use the Intel 8088 in its IBM PC, but its policy at the time was to require at least two sources for its chips. AMD later produced the Am286 under the same arrangement. In 1984, Intel internally decided to no longer cooperate with AMD in supplying product information to shore up its advantage in the marketplace, and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the Intel 80386.[99] In 1987, AMD invoked arbitration over the issue, and Intel reacted by canceling the 1982 technological-exchange agreement altogether.[100][101] After three years of testimony, AMD eventually won in arbitration in 1992, but Intel disputed this decision. Another long legal dispute followed, ending in 1994 when the Supreme Court of California sided with the arbitrator and AMD.[102][103]

In 1990, Intel countersued AMD, renegotiating AMD's right to use derivatives of Intel's microcode for its cloned processors.[104] In the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute, AMD was forced to develop clean room designed versions of Intel code for its x386 and x486 processors, the former long after Intel had released its own x386 in 1985.[105] In March 1991, AMD released the Am386, its clone of the Intel 386 processor.[49] By October of the same year it had sold one million units.[49]

In 1993, AMD introduced the first of the Am486 family of processors,[17] which proved popular with a large number of original equipment manufacturers, including Compaq, which signed an exclusive agreement using the Am486.[9][106][107] The Am5x86, another Am486-based processor, was released in November 1995, and continued AMD's success as a fast, cost-effective processor.[108][109]

Finally, in an agreement effective 1996, AMD received the rights to the microcode in Intel's x386 and x486 processor families, but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors.[110][111]
K5, K6, Athlon, Duron, and Sempron
Main articles: AMD K5, AMD K6, Athlon, Duron, and Sempron

AMD's first in-house x86 processor was the K5, launched in 1996.[112] The "K" in its name was a reference to Kryptonite, the only substance known to harm comic book character Superman. This itself was a reference to Intel's hegemony over the market, i.e., an anthropomorphization of them as Superman.[113] The number "5" was a reference to the fifth generation of x86 processors; rival Intel had previously introduced its line of fifth-generation x86 processors as Pentium because the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked.[114]

In 1996, AMD purchased NexGen, specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them time and money to rework the Nx686. The result was the K6 processor, introduced in 1997. Although it was based on Socket 7, variants such as K6-III/450 were faster than Intel's Pentium II (sixth-generation processor).

The K7 was AMD's seventh-generation x86 processor, making its debut under the brand name Athlon on June 23, 1999. Unlike previous AMD processors, it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intel's, due to licensing issues surrounding Intel's Slot 1 connector, and instead used a Slot A connector, referenced to the Alpha processor bus. The Duron was a lower-cost and limited version of the Athlon (64KB instead of 256KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA (socket A) or soldered directly onto the motherboard. Sempron was released as a lower-cost Athlon XP, replacing Duron in the socket A PGA era. It has since been migrated upward to all new sockets, up to AM3.

On October 9, 2001, the Athlon XP was released. On February 10, 2003, the Athlon XP with 512KB L2 Cache was released.[115]
Athlon 64, Opteron and Phenom
Main articles: Athlon 64, Opteron, and Phenom

The K8 was a major revision of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being the addition of a 64-bit extension to the x86 instruction set (called x86-64, AMD64, or x64), the incorporation of an on-chip memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high-performance point-to-point interconnect called HyperTransport, as part of the Direct Connect Architecture. The technology was initially launched as the Opteron server-oriented processor on April 22, 2003.[116] Shortly thereafter, it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded Athlon 64.[117]

On April 21, 2005, AMD released the first dual-core Opteron, an x86-based server CPU.[118] A month later, it released the Athlon 64 X2, the first desktop-based dual-core processor family.[119] In May 2007, AMD abandoned the string "64" in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of 64-bit computing in its processors. Further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of the target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. In 2008, AMD started to release dual-core Sempron processors exclusively in China, branded as the Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache. AMD completed its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment.

In September 2007, AMD released the first server Opteron K10 processors,[120] followed in November by the Phenom processor for desktop. K10 processors came in dual-core, triple-core,[121] and quad-core versions, with all cores on a single die. AMD released a new platform codenamed "Spider", which used the new Phenom processor, as well as an R770 GPU and a 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series.[122] However, AMD built the Spider at 65nm, which was uncompetitive with Intel's smaller and more power-efficient 45nm.

In January 2009, AMD released a new processor line dubbed Phenom II, a refresh of the original Phenom built using the 45 nm process.[123] AMD's new platform, codenamed "Dragon", used the new Phenom II processor, and an ATI R770 GPU from the R700 GPU family, as well as a 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series.[124] The Phenom II came in dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die, with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. The Phenom II resolved issues that the original Phenom had, including a low clock speed, a small L3 cache, and a Cool'n'Quiet bug that decreased performance. The Phenom II cost less but was not performance-competitive with Intel's mid-to-high-range Core 2 Quads. The Phenom II also enhanced its predecessor's memory controller, allowing it to use DDR3 in a new native socket AM3, while maintaining backward compatibility with AM2+, the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the DDR2 memory that was used with the platform.

In April 2010, AMD released a new Phenom II Hexa-core (6-core) processor codenamed "Thuban".[125] This was a totally new die based on the hexa-core "Istanbul" Opteron processor. It included AMD's "turbo core" technology, which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed.

The Magny Cours and Lisbon server parts were released in 2010.[126] The Magny Cours part came in 8 to 12 cores and the Lisbon part in 4 and 6 core parts. Magny Cours is focused on performance while the Lisbon part is focused on high performance per watt. Magny Cours is an MCM (multi-chip module) with two hexa-core "Istanbul" Opteron parts. This will use a new socket G34 for dual and quad-socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors. Lisbon uses socket C32 certified for dual-socket use or single socket use only and thus will be marketed as Opteron 41xx processors. Both will be built on a 45 nm SOI process.
Fusion becomes the AMD APU
Main articles: AMD APU and AMD mobile platform

Following AMD's 2006 acquisition of Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies, an initiative codenamed Fusion was announced to integrate a CPU and GPU together on some of AMD's microprocessors, including a built in PCI Express link to accommodate separate PCI Express peripherals, eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard. The initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. floating-point unit operations) to the GPU, which is better optimized for some calculations. The Fusion was later renamed the AMD APU (Accelerated Processing Unit).[127]

Llano was AMD's first APU built for laptops. Llano was the second APU released,[128] targeted at the mainstream market.[127] It incorporated a CPU and GPU on the same die, as well as northbridge functions, and used "Socket FM1" with DDR3 memory. The CPU part of the processor was based on the Phenom II "Deneb" processor. AMD suffered an unexpected decrease in revenue based on production problems for the Llano.[129] More AMD APUs for laptops running Windows 7 and Windows 8 OS are being used commonly. These include AMD's price-point APUs, the E1 and E2, and their mainstream competitors with Intel's Core i-series: The Vision A- series, the A standing for accelerated. These range from the lower-performance A4 chipset to the A6, A8, and A10. These all incorporate next-generation Radeon graphics cards, with the A4 utilizing the base Radeon HD chip and the rest using a Radeon R4 graphics card, with the exception of the highest-model A10 (A10-7300) which uses an R6 graphics card.
New microarchitectures
High-power, high-performance Bulldozer cores
Main articles: Bulldozer microarchitecture, Piledriver microarchitecture, Steamroller microarchitecture, and Excavator microarchitecture

Bulldozer was AMD's microarchitecture codename for server and desktop AMD FX processors, first released on October 12, 2011. This family 15h microarchitecture is the successor to the family 10h (K10) microarchitecture design. Bulldozer was a clean-sheet design, not a development of earlier processors.[130] The core was specifically aimed at 10–125 W TDP computing products. AMD claimed dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in high-performance computing (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores. While hopes were high that Bulldozer would bring AMD to be performance-competitive with Intel once more, most benchmarks were disappointing. In some cases the new Bulldozer products were slower than the K10 models they were built to replace.[131][132][133]

The Piledriver microarchitecture was the 2012 successor to Bulldozer, increasing clock speeds and performance relative to its predecessor.[134] Piledriver would be released in AMD FX, APU, and Opteron product lines.[135][136][137][138] Piledriver was subsequently followed by the Steamroller microarchitecture in 2013. Used exclusively in AMD's APUs, Steamroller focused on greater parallelism.[139][140]

In 2015, the Excavator microarchitecture replaced Piledriver.[141] Expected to be the last microarchitecture of the Bulldozer series,[142][143] Excavator focused on improved power efficiency.[144]
Low-power Cat cores
Main articles: Bobcat microarchitecture, Jaguar microarchitecture, and Puma microarchitecture

The Bobcat microarchitecture was revealed during a speech from AMD executive vice-president Henri Richard in Computex 2007 and was put into production during the first quarter of 2011.[128] Based on the difficulty competing in the x86 market with a single core optimized for the 10–100 W range, AMD had developed a simpler core with a target range of 1–10 watts.[145] In addition, it was believed that the core could migrate into the hand-held space if the power consumption can be reduced to less than 1 W.[146]

Jaguar is a microarchitecture codename for Bobcat's successor, released in 2013, that is used in various APUs from AMD aimed at the low-power/low-cost market.[147] Jaguar and its derivates would go on to be used in the custom APUs of the PlayStation 4,[148][149] Xbox One,[150][151] PlayStation 4 Pro,[152][153][154] Xbox One S,[155] and Xbox One X.[156][157] Jaguar would be later followed by the Puma microarchitecture in 2014.[158]
ARM architecture-based designs

In 2012, AMD announced it was working on ARM products, both as a semi-custom product and server product.[159][160][161] The initial server product was announced as the Opteron A1100 in 2014, an 8-core Cortex-A57-based ARMv8-A SoC,[162][163] and was expected to be followed by an APU incorporating a Graphics Core Next GPU.[164] However, the Opteron A1100 was not released until 2016, with the delay attributed to adding software support.[165] The A1100 was also criticized for not having support from major vendors upon its release.[165][166][167]

In 2014, AMD also announced the K12 custom core for release in 2016.[168] While being ARMv8-A instruction set architecture compliant, the K12 was expected to be entirely custom-designed, targeting the server, embedded, and semi-custom markets. While ARM architecture development continued, products based on K12 were subsequently delayed with no release planned. Development of AMD's x86-based Zen microarchitecture was preferred.[169][170]
Zen-based CPUs and APUs
Main article: Zen microarchitecture

Zen is an architecture for x86-64 based Ryzen series of CPUs and APUs, introduced in 2017 by AMD and built from the ground up by a team led by Jim Keller, beginning with his arrival in 2012, and taping out before his departure in September 2015.

One of AMD's primary goals with Zen was an IPC increase of at least 40%, however in February 2017 AMD announced that they had actually achieved a 52% increase.[171][failed verification] Processors made on the Zen architecture are built on the 14 nm FinFET node and have a renewed focus on single-core performance and HSA compatibility.[172] Previous processors from AMD were either built in the 32 nm process ("Bulldozer" and "Piledriver" CPUs) or the 28 nm process ("Steamroller" and "Excavator" APUs). Because of this, Zen is much more energy efficient.

The Zen architecture is the first to encompass CPUs and APUs from AMD built for a single socket (Socket AM4). Also new for this architecture is the implementation of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) technology, something Intel has had for years on some of their processors with their proprietary hyper-threading implementation of SMT. This is a departure from the "Clustered MultiThreading" design introduced with the Bulldozer architecture. Zen also has support for DDR4 memory.

AMD released the Zen-based high-end Ryzen 7 "Summit Ridge" series CPUs on March 2, 2017,[173] mid-range Ryzen 5 series CPUs on April 11, 2017, and entry level Ryzen 3 series CPUs on July 27, 2017.[174] AMD later released the Epyc line of Zen derived server processors for 1P and 2P systems.[175] In October 2017, AMD released Zen-based APUs as Ryzen Mobile, incorporating Vega graphics cores.[176] In January 2018 AMD has announced their new lineup plans, with Ryzen 2.[177] AMD launched CPUs with the 12nm Zen+[178] microarchitecture in April 2018, following up with the 7nm Zen 2 microarchitecture in June 2019, including an update to the Epyc line with new processors using the Zen 2 microarchitecture in August 2019, and Zen 3 slated for release in Q3 2020.

As of 2019, AMD's Ryzen processors were reported to outsell Intel's consumer desktop processors.[179] At CES 2020 AMD announced their Ryzen Mobile 4000, as the first 7 nm x86 mobile processor,[vague] the first 7 nm 8-core (also 16-thread) high-performance mobile processor, and the first 8-core (also 16-thread) processor for ultrathin laptops.[180] This generation is still based on the Zen 2 architecture. In October 2020, AMD announced new processors based on the Zen 3 architecture.[181] On PassMark's Single thread performance test the Ryzen 5 5600x bested all other CPUs besides the Ryzen 9 5950X.[182]

In April 2020, AMD launched three new SKUs which target commercial HPC workloads & hyperconverged infrastructure applications. The launch was based on Epyc’s 7 nm second-generation Rome platform and supported by Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, and Nutanix. IBM Cloud was its first public cloud partner.[183] In August 2022, AMD announced their initial lineup of CPUs based on the new Zen 4 architecture.[184]

The Steam Deck,[185][186] PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S all use chips based on the Zen 2 microarchitecture, with proprietary tweaks and different configurations in each system's implementation than AMD sells in its own commercially available APUs.[187][188] 

ATI prior to AMD acquisition
Main article: ATI Technologies

Lee Ka Lau,[189] Francis Lau, Benny Lau, and Kwok Yuen Ho[190] founded ATI in 1985 as Array Technology Inc.[191] Working primarily in the OEM field, ATI produced integrated graphics cards for PC manufacturers such as IBM and Commodore. By 1987, ATI had grown into an independent graphics-card retailer, introducing EGA Wonder and VGA Wonder card product lines that year.[192] In the early nineties, they released products able to process graphics without the CPU: in May 1991, the Mach8, in 1992 the Mach32, which offered improved memory bandwidth and GUI acceleration. ATI Technologies Inc. went public in 1993, with shares listed on NASDAQ and on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

As the PCB reveals, the layout dates from 1985, whereas the marking on the central chip CW16800-A says "8639"—meaning that chip was manufactured in week 39, 1986. Notice UM6845E CRT controller. This card uses the ISA 8-bit interface.

In 1994, the Mach64 accelerator debuted, powering the Graphics Xpression and Graphics Pro Turbo, offering hardware support for YUV-to-RGB colour space conversion in addition to hardware zoom; early techniques of hardware-based video acceleration.

ATI introduced its first combination of 2D and 3D accelerator under the name 3D Rage. This chip was based on the Mach 64, but it featured elemental 3D acceleration. The ATI Rage line powered almost the entire range of ATI graphics products. In particular, the Rage Pro was one of the first viable 2D-plus-3D alternatives to 3dfx's 3D-only Voodoo chipset. 3D acceleration in the Rage line advanced from the basic functionality within the initial 3D Rage to a more advanced DirectX 6.0 accelerator in 1999 Rage 128.

The All-in-Wonder product line, introduced in 1996, was the first combination of integrated graphics chip with TV tuner card and the first chip that enabled display of computer graphics on a TV set.[193] The cards featured 3D acceleration powered by ATI's 3D Rage II, 64-bit 2D performance, TV-quality video acceleration, analogue video capture, TV tuner functionality, flicker-free TV-out and stereo TV audio reception.

ATI entered the mobile computing sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to laptops in 1996. The Mobility product line had to meet requirements different from those of desktop PCs, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, TMDS output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired Tseng Labs's graphics assets, which included 40 engineers.

The Radeon line of graphics products was unveiled in 2000. The initial Radeon graphics processing unit offered an all-new design with DirectX 7.0 3D acceleration, video acceleration, and 2D acceleration. Technology developed for a specific Radeon generation could be built in varying levels of features and performance in order to provide products suited for the entire market range, from high-end to budget to mobile versions.

In 2000, ATI acquired ArtX, which engineered the Flipper graphics chip used in the GameCube video game console. They also created a modified version of the chip (codenamed Hollywood) for the successor of the GameCube, the Wii. Microsoft contracted ATI to design the graphics core (codenamed Xenos) for the Xbox 360. Later in 2005, ATI acquired Terayon's cable modem silicon intellectual property, strengthening their lead in the consumer digital television market.[194] K. Y. Ho remained as Chairman of the Board until he retired in November 2005. Dave Orton replaced him as the President and CEO of the organization.

On July 24, 2006, a joint announcement revealed that AMD would acquire ATI in a deal valued at $5.6 billion.[195] The acquisition consideration closed on October 25, 2006,[196] and included over $2 billion financed from a loan and 56 million shares of AMD stock.[197] ATI's operations became part of the AMD Graphics Product Group (GPG),[198] and ATI's CEO Dave Orton became the Executive Vice President of Visual and Media Businesses at AMD until his resignation in 2007.[199] The top-level management was reorganized with the Senior Vice President and General Manager, and the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Consumer Electronics Group, both of whom would report to the CEO of AMD.[200] On 30 August 2010, John Trikola announced that AMD would retire the ATI brand for its graphics chipsets in favour of the AMD name.[201]
Radeon within AMD
Main article: Radeon

In 2008, the ATI division of AMD released the TeraScale microarchitecture implementing a unified shader model. This design replaced the previous fixed-function hardware of previous graphics cards with multipurpose, programmable shaders. Initially released as part of the GPU for the Xbox 360, this technology would go on to be used in Radeon branded HD 2000 parts. Three generations of TeraScale would be designed and used in parts from 2008 to 2014.
Combined GPU and CPU divisions

In a 2009 restructuring, AMD merged the CPU and GPU divisions to support the company's APUs, which fused both graphics and general purpose processing.[202][203] In 2011, AMD released the successor to TeraScale, Graphics Core Next (GCN).[204] This new microarchitecture emphasized GPGPU compute capability in addition to graphics processing, with a particular aim of supporting heterogeneous computing on AMD's APUs. GCN's reduced instruction set ISA allowed for significantly increased compute capability over TeraScale's very long instruction word ISA. Since GCN's introduction with the HD 7970, five generations of the GCN architecture have been produced from 2008 through at least 2017.[205]

In September 2015, AMD separated the graphics technology division of the company into an independent internal unit called the Radeon Technologies Group (RTG) headed by Raja Koduri.[206] This gave the graphics division of AMD autonomy in product design and marketing.[207][208] The RTG then went on to create and release the Polaris and Vega microarchitectures released in 2016 and 2017, respectively.[209][210] In particular the Vega, or fifth-generation GCN, microarchitecture includes a number of major revisions to improve performance and compute capabilities.[211][212]

In November 2017, Raja Koduri left RTG[213] and CEO and President Lisa Su took his position. In January 2018, it was reported that two industry veterans joined RTG, namely Mike Rayfield as senior vice president and general manager of RTG, and David Wang as senior vice president of engineering for RTG.[214] In January 2020, AMD announced that its second-generation RDNA graphics architecture was in development, with the aim of competing with the Nvidia RTX graphics products for performance leadership. In October 2020, AMD announced their new RX 6000 series[215] series GPUs, their first high-end product based on RDNA2 and capable of handling ray-tracing natively, aiming to challenge Nvidia's RTX 3000 GPUs.
Semi-custom and game console products

In 2012, AMD's then CEO Rory Read began a program to offer semi-custom designs.[216][217] Rather than AMD simply designing and offering a single product, potential customers could work with AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD's intellectual property. Customers pay a non-recurring engineering fee for design and development, and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. In particular, AMD noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property. These semi-custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and the subsequent PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One S, Xbox One X, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5.[218][219][220][154][157][221] Financially, these semi-custom products would represent a majority of the company's revenue in 2016.[222][223] In November 2017, AMD and Intel announced that Intel would market a product combining in a single package an Intel Core CPU, a semi-custom AMD Radeon GPU, and HBM2 memory.[224]

Before the launch of Athlon 64 processors in 2003, AMD designed chipsets for their processors spanning the K6 and K7 processor generations. The chipsets include the AMD-640, AMD-751, and the AMD-761 chipsets. The situation changed in 2003 with the release of Athlon 64 processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets. This was the "Open Platform Management Architecture" with ATI, VIA and SiS developing their own chipset for Athlon 64 processors and later Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon 64 FX processors, including the Quad FX platform chipset from Nvidia.

The initiative went further with the release of Opteron server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors. As of today,[when?] Nvidia and Broadcom are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors.

As the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in 2006, the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the Radeon Xpress 200 and the Radeon Xpress 3200 chipsets. AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding (for instance, the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as AMD 580X CrossFire chipset). In February 2007, AMD announced the first AMD-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the AMD 690G chipset (previously under the development codename RS690), targeted at mainstream IGP computing. It was the industry's first to implement a HDMI 1.2 port on motherboards, shipping for more than a million units. While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset, the plan was scrapped and the inventories of Radeon Xpress 1250 (codenamed RS600, sold under ATI brand) was sold to two OEMs, Abit and ASRock. Although AMD stated the firm would still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of 1333 MHz FSB to ATI.

On November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the AMD 7-Series chipsets, covering from the enthusiast multi-graphics segment to the value IGP segment, to replace the AMD 480/570/580 chipsets and AMD 690 series chipsets, marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset. Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November 15, 2007, as part of the codenamed Spider desktop platform, and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in spring 2008 as part of the codenamed Cartwheel platform.

AMD returned to the server chipsets market with the AMD 800S series server chipsets. It includes support for up to six SATA 6.0 Gbit/s ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in Fusion processors and AHCI 1.2 with SATA FIS-based switching support. This is a chipset family supporting Phenom processors and Quad FX enthusiast platform (890FX), IGP (890GX).

With the advent of AMD's APUs in 2011, traditional northbridge features such as the connection to graphics and the PCI Express controller were incorporated into the APU die. Accordingly, APUs were connected to a single chip chipset, renamed the Fusion Controller Hub (FCH), which primarily provided southbridge functionality.[225]

AMD released new chipsets in 2017 to support the release of their new Ryzen products. As the Zen microarchitecture already includes much of the northbridge connectivity, the AM4-based chipsets primarily varied in the number of additional PCI Express lanes, USB connections, and SATA connections available.[226] These AM4 chipsets were designed in conjunction with ASMedia.[227]

An AMD Élan SC450 in Nokia 9000 Communicator

In the early 1990s, AMD began marketing a series of embedded system-on-a-chips (SoCs) called AMD Élan, starting with the SC300 and SC310. Both combines a 32-Bit, Am386SX, low-voltage 25 MHz or 33 MHz CPU with memory controller, PC/AT peripheral controllers, real-time clock, PLL clock generators and ISA bus interface. The SC300 integrates in addition two PC card slots and a CGA-compatible LCD controller. They were followed in 1996 by the SC4xx types. Now supporting VESA Local Bus and using the Am486 with up to 100 MHz clock speed. A SC450 with 33 MHze.g. was used in the Nokia 9000 Communicator. In 1999 the SC520 was announced. Using an Am586 with 100 MHz or 133 MHz and supporting SDRAM and PCI it was the latest member of the series.[228][229]

In February 2002, AMD acquired Alchemy Semiconductor for its Alchemy line of MIPS processors for the hand-held and portable media player markets.[230] On June 13, 2006, AMD officially announced that the line was to be transferred to Raza Microelectronics, Inc., a designer of MIPS processors for embedded applications.[231]

In August 2003, AMD also purchased the Geode business which was originally the Cyrix MediaGX from National Semiconductor to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products.[232] During the second quarter of 2004, it launched new low-power Geode NX processors based on the K7 Thoroughbred architecture with speeds of fanless processors 667 MHz and 1 GHz, and 1.4 GHz processor with fan, of TDP 25 W. This technology is used in a variety of embedded systems (Casino slot machines and customer kiosks for instance), several UMPC designs in Asia markets, as well as the OLPC XO-1 computer, an inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children in developing countries around the world.[233] The Geode LX processor was announced in 2005 and is said will continue to be available through 2015.[needs update]

AMD has also introduced 64-bit processors into its embedded product line starting with the AMD Opteron processor. Leveraging the high throughput enabled through HyperTransport and the Direct Connect Architecture these server-class processors have been targeted at high-end telecom and storage applications. In 2007, AMD added the AMD Athlon, AMD Turion, and Mobile AMD Sempron processors to its embedded product line. Leveraging the same 64-bit instruction set and Direct Connect Architecture as the AMD Opteron but at lower power levels, these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications. Throughout 2007 and into 2008, AMD has continued to add both single-core Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors and dual-core AMD Athlon X2 and AMD Turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded 64-bit solutions starting with 8 W TDP Mobile AMD Sempron and AMD Athlon processors for fan-less designs up to multi-processor systems leveraging multi-core AMD Opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability.[234]

The ATI acquisition in 2006 included the Imageon and Xilleon product lines. In late 2008, the entire handheld division was sold off to Qualcomm, who have since produced the Adreno series.[235] Also in 2008, the Xilleon division was sold to Broadcom.[236][237]

In April 2007, AMD announced the release of the M690T integrated graphics chipset for embedded designs. This enabled AMD to offer complete processor and chipset solutions targeted at embedded applications requiring high-performance 3D and video such as emerging digital signage, kiosk, and Point of Sale applications. The M690T was followed by the M690E specifically for embedded applications which removed the TV output, which required Macrovision licensing for OEMs, and enabled native support for dual TMDS outputs, enabling dual independent DVI interfaces.[citation needed][238]

In January 2011, AMD announced the AMD Embedded G-Series Accelerated Processing Unit.[239][240] This was the first APU for embedded applications. These were followed by updates in 2013 and 2016.[241][242]

In May 2012, AMD Announced the AMD Embedded R-Series Accelerated Processing Unit.[243] This family of products incorporates the Bulldozer CPU architecture, and Discrete-class Radeon HD 7000G Series graphics. This was followed by a system-on-a-chip (SoC) version in 2015 which offered a faster CPU and faster graphics, with support for DDR4 SDRAM memory.[244][245]
Embedded graphics

AMD builds graphic processors for use in embedded systems. They can be found in anything from casinos to healthcare, with a large portion of products being used in industrial machines.[246] These products include a complete graphics processing device in a compact multi-chip module including RAM and the GPU.[247] ATI began offering embedded GPUs with the E2400 in 2008. Since that time AMD has released regular updates to their embedded GPU lineup in 2009, 2011, 2015, and 2016; reflecting improvements in their GPU technology.[247][248][249][250]

Production and fabrication
Main article: GlobalFoundries

Previously, AMD produced its chips at company-owned semiconductor foundries. AMD pursued a strategy of collaboration with other semiconductor manufacturers IBM and Motorola to co-develop production technologies.[267][268] AMD's founder Jerry Sanders termed this the "Virtual Gorilla" strategy to compete with Intel's significantly greater investments in fabrication.[269]

In 2008, AMD spun off its chip foundries into an independent company named GlobalFoundries.[270] This breakup of the company was attributed to the increasing costs of each process node. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi purchased the newly created company through its subsidiary Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), purchasing the final stake from AMD in 2009.[271]

With the spin-off of its foundries, AMD became a fabless semiconductor manufacturer, designing products to be produced at for-hire foundries. Part of the GlobalFoundries spin-off included an agreement with AMD to produce some number of products at GlobalFoundries.[272] Both prior to the spin-off and after AMD has pursued production with other foundries including TSMC and Samsung.[273][274] It has been argued that this would reduce risk for AMD by decreasing dependence on any one foundry which has caused issues in the past.[274][275]

In 2018, AMD started shifting the production of their CPUs and GPUs to TSMC, following GlobalFoundries' announcement that they were halting development of their 7 nm process.[276] AMD revised their wafer purchase requirement with GlobalFoundries in 2019, allowing AMD to freely choose foundries for 7 nm nodes and below, while maintaining purchase agreements for 12 nm and above through 2021.[277]
Corporate affairs
Partnerships

AMD uses strategic industry partnerships to further its business interests as well as to rival Intel's dominance and resources:[267][268][269]

    A partnership between AMD and Alpha Processor Inc. developed HyperTransport, a point-to-point interconnect standard which was turned over to an industry standards body for finalization.[278] It is now used in modern motherboards that are compatible with AMD processors.
    AMD also formed a strategic partnership with IBM, under which AMD gained silicon on insulator (SOI) manufacturing technology, and detailed advice on 90 nm implementation. AMD announced that the partnership would extend to 2011 for 32 nm and 22 nm fabrication-related technologies.[279]
    To facilitate processor distribution and sales, AMD is loosely partnered with end-user companies, such as HP, Dell, Asus, Acer, and Microsoft.[280]
    In 1993, AMD established a 50–50 partnership with Fujitsu called FASL, and merged into a new company called FASL LLC in 2003. The joint venture went public under the name Spansion and ticker symbol SPSN in December 2005, with AMD shares dropping 37%. AMD no longer directly participates in the Flash memory devices market now as AMD entered into a non-competition agreement on December 21, 2005, with Fujitsu and Spansion, pursuant to which it agreed not to directly or indirectly engage in a business that manufactures or supplies standalone semiconductor devices (including single-chip, multiple-chip or system devices) containing only Flash memory.[281]
    On May 18, 2006, Dell announced that it would roll out new servers based on AMD's Opteron chips by year's end, thus ending an exclusive relationship with Intel.[282] In September 2006, Dell began offering AMD Athlon X2 chips in their desktop lineup.
    In June 2011, HP announced new business and consumer notebooks equipped with the latest versions of AMD APUs – accelerated processing units. AMD will power HP's Intel-based business notebooks as well.[283]
    In the spring of 2013, AMD announced that it would be powering all three major next-generation consoles.[284] The Xbox One and Sony PlayStation 4 are both powered by a custom-built AMD APU, and the Nintendo Wii U is powered by an AMD GPU.[285] According to AMD, having their processors in all three of these consoles will greatly assist developers with cross-platform development to competing consoles and PCs as well as increased support for their products across the board.[286]
    AMD has entered into an agreement with Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC) for the production of AMD products in India.[287]
    AMD is a founding member of the HSA Foundation which aims to ease the use of a Heterogeneous System Architecture. A Heterogeneous System Architecture is intended to use both central processing units and graphics processors to complete computational tasks.[288]
    AMD announced in 2016 that it was creating a joint venture to produce x86 server chips for the Chinese market.[289]
    On May 7, 2019, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Cray Inc., are working in collaboration with AMD to develop the Frontier exascale supercomputer. Featuring the AMD Epyc CPUs and Radeon GPUs, the supercomputer is set to produce more than 1.5 exaflops (peak double-precision) in computing performance. It is expected to debut sometime in 2021.[290]
    On March 5, 2020, it was announced that the U.S. Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and HPE are working in collaboration with AMD to develop the El Capitan exascale supercomputer. Featuring the AMD Epyc CPUs and Radeon GPUs, the supercomputer is set to produce more than 2 exaflops (peak double-precision) in computing performance. It is expected to debut in 2023.[291]
    In the summer of 2020, it was reported that AMD would be powering the next-generation console offerings from Microsoft and Sony.[292]
    On November 8, 2021, AMD announced a partnership with Meta to make the chips used in the Metaverse.[293]
    In January 2022, AMD partnered with Samsung to develop a mobile processor to be used in future products. The processor was named Exynos 2022 and works with the AMD RDNA 2 architecture.[294]

Litigation with Intel
See also: Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. v. Intel Corp.
AMD processor with Intel logo

AMD has a long history of litigation with former (and current) partner and x86 creator Intel.[295][296][297]

    In 1986, Intel broke an agreement it had with AMD to allow them to produce Intel's microchips for IBM; AMD filed for arbitration in 1987 and the arbitrator decided in AMD's favor in 1992. Intel disputed this, and the case ended up in the Supreme Court of California. In 1994, that court upheld the arbitrator's decision and awarded damages for breach of contract.
    In 1990, Intel brought a copyright infringement action alleging illegal use of its 287 microcode. The case ended in 1994 with a jury finding for AMD and its right to use Intel's microcode in its microprocessors through the 486 generation.
    In 1997, Intel filed suit against AMD and Cyrix Corp. for misuse of the term MMX. AMD and Intel settled, with AMD acknowledging MMX as a trademark owned by Intel, and with Intel granting AMD rights to market the AMD K6 MMX processor.
    In 2005, following an investigation, the Japan Federal Trade Commission found Intel guilty of a number of violations. On June 27, 2005, AMD won an antitrust suit against Intel in Japan, and on the same day, AMD filed a broad antitrust complaint against Intel in the U.S. Federal District Court in Delaware. The complaint alleges systematic use of secret rebates, special discounts, threats, and other means used by Intel to lock AMD processors out of the global market. Since the start of this action, the court has issued subpoenas to major computer manufacturers including Acer, Dell, Lenovo, HP and Toshiba.
    In November 2009, Intel agreed to pay AMD $1.25 billion and renew a five-year patent cross-licensing agreement as part of a deal to settle all outstanding legal disputes between them.[298]

Guinness World Record achievement

    On August 31, 2011, in Austin, Texas, AMD achieved a Guinness World Record for the "Highest frequency of a computer processor": 8.429 GHz.[299] The company ran an 8-core FX-8150 processor with only one active module (two cores), and cooled with liquid helium.[300] The previous record was 8.308 GHz, with an Intel Celeron 352 (one core).
    On November 1, 2011, geek.com reported that Andre Yang, an overclocker from Taiwan, used an FX-8150 to set another record: 8.461 GHz.[301]
    On November 19, 2012, Andre Yang used an FX-8350 to set another record: 8.794 GHz.[302]

The Linux kernel is a free and open-source,[12]: 4  monolithic, modular, multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel. It was originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his i386-based PC, and it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, which was written to be a free (libre) replacement for Unix.

Linux is provided under the GNU General Public License version 2 only, but it contains files under other compatible licenses.[11] Since the late 1990s, it has been included as part of a large number of operating system distributions, many of which are commonly also called Linux.

Linux is deployed on a wide variety of computing systems, such as embedded devices, mobile devices (including its use in the Android operating system), personal computers, servers, mainframes, and supercomputers.[13] It can be tailored for specific architectures and for several usage scenarios using a family of simple commands (that is, without the need of manually editing its source code before compilation);[14][15][16] privileged users can also fine-tune kernel parameters at runtime.[17][18][19] Most of the Linux kernel code is written using the GNU extensions of GCC[12]: 18 [20] to the standard C programming language and with the use of architecture-specific instructions (ISA) in limited parts of the kernel. This produces a highly optimized executable (vmlinux) with respect to utilization of memory space and task execution times.[12]: 379–380 

Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML). Changes are tracked using the version control system git, which was originally authored by Torvalds as a free software replacement for BitKeeper.
History
See also: History of Linux and Linux kernel version history
Linus Torvalds at the LinuxCon Europe 2014 in Düsseldorf

In April 1991, Linus Torvalds, at the time a 21-year-old computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland, started working on some simple ideas for an operating system inspired by UNIX, for a personal computer.[21] He started with a task switcher in Intel 80386 assembly language and a terminal driver.[21] On 25 August 1991, Torvalds posted the following to comp.os.minix, a newsgroup on Usenet:[22]

    I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since April, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
    I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months [...]
    Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT protable [sic] (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.

On 17 September 1991, Torvalds prepared version 0.01 of Linux and put on the "ftp.funet.fi" – FTP server of the Finnish University and Research Network (FUNET). It was not even executable since its code still needed Minix to compile and test it.[23]

On 5 October 1991, Torvalds announced the first "official" version of Linux, version 0.02.[24] At this point, Linux was able to run Bash, GCC, and some other GNU utilities:[24][23]

    [As] I mentioned a month ago, I'm working on a free version of a Minix-lookalike for AT-386 computers. It has finally reached the stage where it's even usable (though may not be depending on what you want), and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution. It is just version 0.02...but I've successfully run bash, gcc, gnu-make, gnu-sed, compress, etc. under it.

After that, despite the limited functionality of the early versions, Linux rapidly gained developers and users. Many people contributed code to the project, including some developers from the MINIX community.[citation needed] At the time, the GNU Project had created many of the components required for its free UNIX replacement, the GNU operating system, but its own kernel, GNU Hurd, was incomplete. For this reason, it soon adopted the Linux kernel as well.[25] The Berkeley Software Distribution had not yet freed itself from legal encumbrances and was not competing in the space for a free OS kernel.[26]

Torvalds assigned version 0 to the kernel to indicate that it was mainly for testing and not intended for productive use.[27] Version 0.11, released in December 1991, was the first self-hosted Linux, for it could be compiled by a computer running the same kernel.

When Torvalds released version 0.12 in February 1992, he adopted the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) over his previous self-drafted license, which had not permitted commercial redistribution.[28] In contrast to Unix, all source files of Linux are freely available, including device drivers.[29] The initial success of Linux was driven by programmers and testers across the world. With the support of the POSIX APIs, through the libC that, whether needed, acts as an entry point to the kernel address space, Linux could run software and applications that had been developed for Unix.[30]
The Linux kernel supports various hardware architectures, providing a common platform for software, including proprietary software.

On 19 January 1992, the first post to the new newsgroup alt.os.linux was submitted.[31] On 31 March 1992, the newsgroup was renamed comp.os.linux.[32] The fact that Linux is a monolithic kernel rather than a microkernel was the topic of a debate between Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the creator of MINIX, and Torvalds.[33] The Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate started in 1992 on the Usenet group comp.os.minix as a general discussion about kernel architectures.[34][35]

Linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running the X Window System.[36] In March 1994, Linux 1.0.0 was released with 176,250 lines of code.[37] It was the first version suitable for use in production environments.[27]

It started a versioning system for the kernel with three or four numbers separated by dots where the first represented the major release, the second was the minor release, and the third was the revision.[12]: 9  At that time odd-numbered minor releases were for development and tests, whilst even numbered minor releases were for production. The optional fourth digit indicated a set of patches to a revision.[27] Development releases were indicated with -rc ("release candidate") suffix.

The current version numbering is slightly different from the above. The even vs. odd numbering has been dropped, and a specific major version is now indicated by the first two numbers, taken as a whole. While the time-frame is open for the development of the next major, the -rcN suffix is used to identify the n'th release candidate for the next version.[38] For example, the release of the version 4.16 was preceded by seven 4.16-rcN (from -rc1 to -rc7). Once a stable release is made, its maintenance is passed off to the "stable team". Occasional updates to stable releases are identified by a three numbering scheme (e.g., 4.13.1, 4.13.2, ..., 4.13.16).[38]

After version 1.3 of the kernel, Torvalds decided that Linux had evolved enough to warrant a new major number, so he released version 2.0.0 in June 1996.[39][40] The series included 41 releases. The major feature of 2.0 was support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and support for more types of processors.

Starting with version 2.0, Linux is configurable for selecting specific hardware targets and for enabling architecture-specific features and optimizations.[30] The make *config family of commands of kbuild are used to enable and configure thousands of options for building ad hoc kernel executables (vmlinux) and loadable modules.[14][15]

Version 2.2, released on 20 January 1999,[41] improved locking granularity and SMP management, added m68k, PowerPC, Sparc64, Alpha, and other 64-bit platforms support.[42] Furthermore, it added new file systems including Microsoft's NTFS read-only capability.[42] In 1999, IBM published its patches to the Linux 2.2.13 code for the support of the S/390 architecture.[43]

Version 2.4.0, released on 4 January 2001,[44] contained support for ISA Plug and Play, USB, and PC Cards. Linux 2.4 added support for the Pentium 4 and Itanium (the latter introduced the ia64 ISA that was jointly developed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard to supersede the older PA-RISC), and for the newer 64-bit MIPS processor.[45] Development for 2.4.x changed a bit in that more features were made available throughout the series, including support for Bluetooth, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) version 1, RAID support, InterMezzo and ext3 file systems.

Version 2.6.0 was released on 17 December 2003.[46] The development for 2.6.x changed further towards including new features throughout the series. Among the changes that have been made in the 2.6 series are: integration of µClinux into the mainline kernel sources, PAE support, support for several new lines of CPUs, integration of Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) into the mainline kernel sources, support for up to 232 users (up from 216), support for up to 229 process IDs (64-bit only, 32-bit architectures still limited to 215),[47] substantially increased the number of device types and the number of devices of each type, improved 64-bit support, support for file systems which support file sizes of up to 16 terabytes, in-kernel preemption, support for the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL), User-mode Linux integration into the mainline kernel sources, SELinux integration into the mainline kernel sources, InfiniBand support, and considerably more.

Also notable are the addition of a wide selection of file systems starting with the 2.6.x releases: now, the kernel supports a large number of file systems, some that have been designed for Linux, like ext3, ext4, FUSE, Btrfs,[48] and others that are native of other operating systems like JFS, XFS, Minix, Xenix, Irix, Solaris, System V, Windows and MS-DOS.[49]

In 2005 the stable team was formed as a response to the lack of a kernel tree where people could work on bug fixes, and it would keep updating stable versions.[50] In February 2008 the linux-next tree was created to serve as a place where patches aimed to be merged during the next development cycle gathered.[51][52] Several subsystem maintainers also adopted the suffix -next for trees containing code which they mean to submit for inclusion in the next release cycle. As of January 2014, the in-development version of Linux is held in an unstable branch named linux-next.[53]

Linux used to be maintained without the help of an automated source code management system until, in 2002, development switched to BitKeeper. It was freely available for Linux developers but it was not free software. In 2005, because of efforts to reverse-engineer it, the company which owned the software revoked its support of the Linux community. In response, Torvalds and others wrote Git. The new system was written within weeks, and in two months the first official kernel made using it was released.[54]

Details on the history of the 2.6 kernel series can be found in the ChangeLog files on the 2.6 kernel series source code release area of kernel.org.[55]

The 20th anniversary of Linux was celebrated by Torvalds in July 2011 with the release of the 3.0.0 kernel version.[39] As 2.6 had been the version number for 8 years, a new uname26 personality that reports 3.x as 2.6.40+x had to be added to the kernel so that old programs would work.[56]

Version 3.0 was released on 22 July 2011.[57] On 30 May 2011, Torvalds announced that the big change was "NOTHING. Absolutely nothing." and asked, "...let's make sure we really make the next release not just an all new shiny number, but a good kernel too."[58] After the expected 6–7 weeks of the development process, it would be released near the 20th anniversary of Linux.

On 11 December 2012, Torvalds decided to reduce kernel complexity by removing support for i386 processors, making the 3.7 kernel series the last one still supporting the original processor.[59][60] The same series unified support for the ARM processor.[61]

Version 3.11, released on 2 September 2013,[62] adds many new features such as new O_TMPFILE flag for open(2) to reduce temporary file vulnerabilities, experimental AMD Radeon dynamic power management, low-latency network polling, and zswap (compressed swap cache).[63]

The numbering change from 2.6.39 to 3.0, and from 3.19 to 4.0, involved no meaningful technical differentiation. The major version number was increased to avoid large minor numbers.[57][64] Stable 3.x.y kernels were released until 3.19 in February 2015.

In April 2015, Torvalds released kernel version 4.0.[39] By February 2015, Linux had received contributions from nearly 12,000 programmers from more than 1,200 companies, including some of the world's largest software and hardware vendors.[65] Version 4.1 of Linux, released in June 2015, contains over 19.5 million lines of code contributed by almost 14,000 programmers.[66]

A total of 1,991 developers, of whom 334 were first-time collaborators, added more than 553,000 lines of code to version 5.8, breaking the record previously held by version 4.9.[67]
Main article: Usage share of operating systems

According to the Stack Overflow's annual Developer Survey of 2019, more than the 53% of all respondents have developed software for Linux and about 27% for Android,[68] although only about 25% develop with Linux-based operating systems.[69]

Most websites run on Linux-based operating systems,[70][71] and all of the world's 500 most powerful supercomputers use some kind of OS based on Linux.[72]

Linux distributions bundle the kernel with system software (e.g., the GNU C Library, systemd, and other Unix utilities and daemons) and a wide selection of application software, but their usage share in desktops is low in comparison to other operating systems.

Android, which accounts for the majority of the installed base of all operating systems for mobile devices,[73][74][75] is responsible for the rising usage of the Linux kernel,[30] together with its wide use in a large variety of embedded devices.
Architecture and features

Map of the Linux kernel
Sankey diagram of Linux Kernel Source Lines of Code

Linux is a monolithic kernel with a modular design (i.e., it can insert and remove loadable kernel modules at runtime),[12]: 338 [76] supporting most features once only available in closed source kernels of non-free operating systems. The rest of the article makes use of the UNIX and Unix-like operating systems convention on the official manual pages. The numbers that follow the name of commands, interfaces, and other features, have the purpose of specifying the section (i.e., the type of the OS' component or feature) they belong to (e.g., execve(2) refers to a system call, while exec(3) refers to a userspace library wrapper). The following list and the subsequent sections describe a non-comprehensive overview of Linux architectural design and of some of its noteworthy features.

    Concurrent computing and (with the availability of enough CPU cores for tasks that are ready to run) even true parallel execution of many processes at once (each of them having one or more threads of execution) on SMP and NUMA architectures.
    Selection and configuration of hundreds of kernel features and drivers (using one of the make *config family of commands, before running compilation),[16][15][14] modification of kernel parameters before booting (usually by inserting instructions into the lines of the GRUB2 menu), and fine tuning of kernel behavior at run-time (using the sysctl(8) interface to /proc/sys/).[17][18][19]
    Configuration (again using the make *config commands) and run-time modifications of the policies[77] (via nice(2), setpriority(2), and the family of sched_*(2) syscalls) of the task schedulers that allow preemptive multitasking (both in user mode and, since the 2.6 series, in kernel mode[78][79]); the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) is the default scheduler of Linux since 2007 and it uses a red-black tree which can search, insert and delete process information (task struct) with O(log n) time complexity, where n is the number of runnable tasks.[80][81]
    Advanced memory management with paged virtual memory.
    Inter-process communications and synchronization mechanism.
    A virtual filesystem on top of several concrete filesystems (ext4, Btrfs, XFS, JFS, FAT32, and many more).
    Configurable I/O schedulers, ioctl(2)[82] syscall that manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files (it is a non standard system call, since arguments, returns, and semantics depends on the device driver in question), support for POSIX asynchronous I/O[83] (however, because they scale poorly with multithreaded applications, a family of Linux specific I/O system calls (io_*(2)[84]) had to be created for the management of asynchronous I/O contexts suitable for concurrently processing).
    OS-level virtualization (with Linux-VServer), paravirtualization and hardware-assisted virtualization (with KVM or Xen, and using QEMU for hardware emulation);[85][86][87][88][89][90] On the Xen hypervisor, the Linux kernel provides support to build Linux distributions (such as openSUSE Leap and many others) that work as Dom0, that are virtual machine host servers that provide the management environment for the user's virtual machines (DomU).[91]
    I/O Virtualization with VFIO and SR-IOV. Virtual Function I/O (VFIO) exposes direct device access to user space in a secure memory (IOMMU) protected environment. With VFIO, a VM Guest can directly access hardware devices on the VM Host Server. This technique improves performance, if compared both to Full virtualization and Paravirtualization. However, with VFIO, devices cannot be shared with multiple VM guests. Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) combines the performance gains of VFIO and the ability to share a device with several VM Guests (but it requires special hardware that must be capable to appear to two or more VM guests as different devices).[92]
    Security mechanisms for discretionary and mandatory access control (SELinux, AppArmor, POSIX ACLs, and others).[93][94]
    Several types of layered communication protocols (including the Internet protocol suite).
    Asymmetric multiprocessing via the RPMsg subsystem.

Most device drivers and kernel extensions run in kernel space (ring 0 in many CPU architectures), with full access to the hardware. Some exceptions run in user space; notable examples are filesystems based on FUSE/CUSE, and parts of UIO.[95][96] Furthermore, the X Window System and Wayland, the windowing system and display server protocols that most people use with Linux, do not run within the kernel. Differently, the actual interfacing with GPUs of graphics cards is an in-kernel subsystem called Direct Rendering Manager (DRM).

Unlike standard monolithic kernels, device drivers are easily configured as modules, and loaded or unloaded while the system is running and can also be pre-empted under certain conditions in order to handle hardware interrupts correctly and to better support symmetric multiprocessing.[79] By choice, Linux has no stable device driver application binary interface.[97]

Linux typically makes use of memory protection and virtual memory and can also handle non-uniform memory access,[98] however the project has absorbed μClinux which also makes it possible to run Linux on microcontrollers without virtual memory.[99]

The hardware is represented in the file hierarchy. User applications interact with device drivers via entries in the /dev or /sys directories.[100] Processes information as well are mapped to the file system through the /proc directory.[100]

Interfaces
Main pages: Linux kernel interfaces and Interfaces of the Linux kernel (Category)
See also: System call, POSIX, and Single UNIX Specification
Four interfaces are distinguished: two internal to the kernel, and two between the kernel and userspace.

Linux is a clone of UNIX, and aims toward POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance.[102] The kernel also provides system calls and other interfaces that are Linux-specific. In order to be included in the official kernel, the code must comply with a set of licensing rules.[6][11]

The Linux Application binary interface (ABI) between the kernel and the user space has four degrees of stability (stable, testing, obsolete, removed);[103] however, the system calls are expected to never change in order to not break the userspace programs that rely on them.[104]

Loadable kernel modules (LKMs), by design, cannot rely on a stable ABI.[97] Therefore, they must always be recompiled whenever a new kernel executable is installed in a system, otherwise they will not be loaded. In-tree drivers that are configured to become an integral part of the kernel executable (vmlinux) are statically linked by the building process.

There is also no guarantee of stability of source-level in-kernel API[97] and, because of this, device drivers code, as well as the code of any other kernel subsystem, must be kept updated with kernel evolution. Any developer who makes an API change is required to fix any code that breaks as the result of their change.[105]
Kernel-to-userspace API

The set of the Linux kernel API that regards the interfaces exposed to user applications is fundamentally composed of UNIX and Linux-specific system calls.[106] A system call is an entry point into the Linux kernel.[107] For example, among the Linux-specific ones there is the family of the clone(2) system calls.[108] Most extensions must be enabled by defining the _GNU_SOURCE macro in a header file or when the user-land code is being compiled.[109]

System calls can only be invoked by using assembly instructions which enable the transition from unprivileged user space to privileged kernel space in ring 0. For this reason, the C standard library (libC) acts as a wrapper to most Linux system calls, by exposing C functions that, only whether it is needed,[110] can transparently enter into the kernel which will execute on behalf of the calling process.[106] For those system calls not exposed by libC, e.g. the fast userspace mutex (futex),[111] the library provides a function called syscall(2) which can be used to explicitly invoke them.[112]

Pseudo filesystems (e.g., the sysfs and procfs filesystems) and special files (e.g., /dev/random, /dev/sda, /dev/tty, and many others) constitute another layer of interface to kernel data structures representing hardware or logical (software) devices.[113][114]
Kernel-to-userspace ABI
Main article: Linux Standard Base

Because of the differences existing between the hundreds of various implementations of the Linux OS, executable objects, even though they are compiled, assembled, and linked for running on a specific hardware architecture (that is, they use the ISA of the target hardware), often cannot run on different Linux Distributions. This issue is mainly due to distribution-specific configurations and a set of patches applied to the code of the Linux kernel, differences in system libraries, services (daemons), filesystem hierarchies, and environment variables.

The main standard concerning application and binary compatibility of Linux distributions is the Linux Standard Base (LSB).[115][116] However, the LSB goes beyond what concerns the Linux kernel, because it also defines the desktop specifications, the X libraries and Qt that have little to do with it.[117] The LSB version 5 is built upon several standards and drafts (POSIX, SUS, X/Open, File System Hierarchy (FHS), and others).[118]

The parts of the LSB largely relevant to the kernel are the General ABI (gABI),[119] especially the System V ABI[120][121] and the Executable and Linking Format (ELF),[122][123] and the Processor Specific ABI (psABI), for example the Core Specification for X86-64.[124][125]

The standard ABI for how x86_64 user programs invoke system calls is to load the syscall number into the rax register, and the other parameters into rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8, and r9, and finally to put the syscall assembly instruction in the code.[126][127][128]
In-kernel API
At XDC2014, Alex Deucher from AMD announced the unified kernel-mode driver.[129] The proprietary Linux graphic driver, libGL-fglrx-glx, will share the same DRM infrastructure with Mesa 3D. As there is no stable in-kernel ABI, AMD had to constantly adapt the former binary blob used by Catalyst.

There are several kernel internal APIs utilized between the different subsystems. Some are available only within the kernel subsystems, while a somewhat limited set of in-kernel symbols (i.e., variables, data structures, and functions) is exposed also to dynamically loadable modules (e.g., device drivers loaded on demand) whether they're exported with the EXPORT_SYMBOL() and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() macros[130][131] (the latter reserved to modules released under a GPL-compatible license).[132]

Linux provides in-kernel APIs that manipulate data structures (e.g., linked lists, radix trees,[133] red-black trees,[134] queues) or perform common routines (e.g., copy data from and to user space, allocate memory, print lines to the system log, and so on) that have remained stable at least since Linux version 2.6.[135][136][137]

In-kernel APIs include libraries of low-level common services used by device drivers:

    SCSI Interfaces and libATA – respectively, a peer-to-peer packet based communication protocol for storage devices attached to USB, SATA, SAS, Fibre Channel, FireWire, ATAPI device,[138] and an in-kernel library to support [S]ATA host controllers and devices.[139]
    Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) and Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) – for interfacing with GPUs and supporting the needs of modern 3D-accelerated video hardware,[140] and for setting screen resolution, color depth and refresh rate[141]
    DMA buffers (DMA-BUF) – for sharing buffers for hardware direct memory access across multiple device drivers and subsystems[142][143][144]
    Video4Linux – for video capture hardware
    Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) – for sound cards
    New API – for network interface controllers
    mac80211 and cfg80211 – for wireless network interface controllers[145][146]

In-kernel ABI

The Linux developers chose not to maintain a stable in-kernel ABI. Modules compiled for a specific version of the kernel cannot be loaded into another version without being recompiled, assuming that the in-kernel API has remained the same at the source level; otherwise, the module code must also be modified accordingly.[97]
Processes and threads
	
This section may be confusing or unclear to readers. In particular, it does little to describe the overall model and focuses on minute technical interface details unlikely to provide clear context. Please help clarify the section. There might be a discussion about this on the talk page. (July 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
See also: Process (computing), Thread (computing), and Process management (computing)

Linux creates processes by means of the clone(2) or by the newer clone3(2)[147] system calls. Depending on the given parameters, the new entity can share most or none of the resources of the caller. These syscalls can create new entities ranging from new independent processes (each having a special identifier called TGID within the task_struct data structure in kernel space, although that same identifier is called PID in userspace), to new threads of execution within the calling process (by using the CLONE_THREAD parameter). In this latter case the new entity owns the same TGID of the calling process and consequently has also the same PID in userspace.[148][149]

If the executable is dynamically linked to shared libraries, a dynamic linker (for ELF objects, it is typically /lib/ld-linux.so.2) is used to find and load the needed objects, prepare the program to run and then run it.[150]

The Native POSIX Thread Library, simply known as the NPTL,[151] provides the standard POSIX threads interface (pthreads) to userspace.[152] Whenever a new thread is created using the pthread_create(3) POSIX interface,[153] the clone(2) family of system calls must also be given the address of the function that the new thread must jump to. The Linux kernel provides the futex(7) (acronym for "Fast user-space mutexes") mechanisms for fast user-space locking and synchronization;[154] the majority of the operations are performed in userspace but it may be necessary to communicate with the kernel using the futex(2) system call.[111]

A very special category of threads is the so-called kernel threads. They must not be confused with the above-mentioned threads of execution of the user's processes. Kernel threads exist only in kernel space and their only purpose is to concurrently run kernel tasks.[155]

Differently, whenever an independent process is created, the syscalls return exactly to the next instruction of the same program, concurrently in parent process and in child's one (i.e., one program, two processes). Different return values (one per process) enable the program to know in which of the two processes it is currently executing. Programs need this information because the child process, a few steps after process duplication, usually invokes the execve(2) system call (possibly via the family of exec(3) wrapper functions in glibC) and replace the program that is currently being run by the calling process with a new program, with newly initialized stack, heap, and (initialized and uninitialized) data segments.[156] When it is done, it results in two processes that run two different programs.

Depending on the effective user id (euid), and on the effective group id (egid), a process running with user zero privileges (root, the system administrator, owns the identifier 0) can perform everything (e.g., kill all the other processes or recursively wipe out whole filesystems), instead non zero user processes cannot. capabilities(7) divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, which can be independently enabled and disabled by the parent process or dropped by the child itself.[157]
Scheduling and preemption
Main articles: Completely Fair Scheduler and Earliest eligible virtual deadline first scheduling

The Linux process scheduler is modular, in the sense that it enables different scheduling classes and policies.[158][159] Scheduler classes are plugable scheduler algorithms that can be registered with the base scheduler code. Each class schedules different types of processes. The core code of the scheduler iterates over each class in order of priority and chooses the highest priority scheduler that has a schedulable entity of type struct sched_entity ready to run.[12]: 46–47  Entities may be threads, group of threads, and even all the processes of a specific user.

Linux provides both user preemption as well as full kernel preemption.[12]: 62–63  Preemption reduces latency, increases responsiveness,[160] and makes Linux more suitable for desktop and real-time applications.

For normal tasks, by default, the kernel uses the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) class, introduced in the 2.6.23 version of the kernel.[80] Internally this default-scheduler class is defined in a macro of a C header as SCHED_NORMAL. In other POSIX kernels, a similar policy known as SCHED_OTHER allocates CPU timeslices (i.e, it assigns absolute slices of the processor time depending on either predetermined or dynamically computed priority of each process). The Linux CFS does away with absolute timeslices and assigns a fair proportion of CPU time, as a function of parameters like the total number of runnable processes and the time they have already run; this function also takes into account a kind of weight that depends on their relative priorities (nice values).[12]: 46–50 

With user preemption, the kernel scheduler can replace the current process with the execution of a context switch to a different one that therefore acquires the computing resources for running (CPU, memory, and more). It makes it according to the CFS algorithm (in particular, it uses a variable called vruntime for sorting entities and then chooses the one that has the smaller vruntime, - i.e., the schedulable entity that has had the least share of CPU time), to the active scheduler policy and to the relative priorities.[161] With kernel preemption, the kernel can preempt itself when an interrupt handler returns, when kernel tasks block, and whenever a subsystem explicitly calls the schedule() function.

The kernel also contains two POSIX-compliant[162] real-time scheduling classes named SCHED_FIFO (realtime first-in-first-out) and SCHED_RR (realtime round-robin), both of which take precedence over the default class.[158] An additional scheduling policy known as SCHED DEADLINE, implementing the earliest deadline first algorithm (EDF), was added in kernel version 3.14, released on 30 March 2014.[163][164] SCHED_DEADLINE takes precedence over all the other scheduling classes.

Real-time PREEMPT_RT patches, included into the mainline Linux since version 2.6, provide a deterministic scheduler, the removal of preemption and interrupts disabling (where possible), PI Mutexes (i.e., locking primitives that avoid priority inversion),[165][166] support for High Precision Event Timers (HPET), preemptive read-copy-update (RCU), (forced) IRQ threads, and other minor features.[167][168][169]

In 2023, Peter Zijlstra proposed replacing CFS with an earliest eligible virtual deadline first scheduling (EEVDF) scheduler,[170][171] to prevent the need for CFS "latency nice" patches.[172] The EEVDF scheduler replaced CFS in version 6.6 of the Linux kernel.[173]
Concurrency and synchronization

The kernel has different causes of concurrency (e.g., interrupts, bottom halves, preemption of kernel and users tasks, symmetrical multiprocessing).[12]: 167  For protecting critical regions (sections of code that must be executed atomically), shared memory locations (like global variables and other data structures with global scope), and regions of memory that are asynchronously modifiable by hardware (e.g., having the C volatile type qualifier), Linux provides a large set of tools. They consist of atomic types (which can only be manipulated by a set of specific operators), spinlocks, semaphores, mutexes,[174][12]: 176–198 [175] and lockless algorithms (e.g., RCUs).[176][177][178] Most lock-less algorithms are built on top of memory barriers for the purpose of enforcing memory ordering and prevent undesired side effects due to compiler optimization.[179][180][181][182]

PREEMPT_RT code included in mainline Linux provide RT-mutexes, a special kind of Mutex which do not disable preemption and have support for priority inheritance.[183][184] Almost all locks are changed into sleeping locks when using configuration for realtime operation.[185][169][184] Priority inheritance avoids priority inversion by granting a low-priority task which holds a contended lock the priority of a higher-priority waiter until that lock is released.[186][187]

Linux includes a kernel lock validator called Lockdep.[188][189]
Interrupts management

The management of the interrupts, although it could be seen as a single job, is divided in two separate parts. This split in two is due to the different time constraints and to the synchronization needs of the tasks whose the management is composed of. The first part is made up of an asynchronous interrupt service routine that in Linux is known as the top half, while the second part is carried out by one of three types of the so-called bottom halves (softirq, tasklets, and work queues).[12]: 133–137  Linux interrupts service routines can be nested (i.e., a new IRQ can trap into a high priority ISR that preempts any other lower priority ISRs).
Memory management
See also: Memory management and Virtual memory

Memory management in Linux is a complex topic. First of all, the kernel is not pageable (i.e., it is always resident in physical memory and cannot be swapped to the disk). In the kernel there is no memory protection (no SIGSEGV signals, unlike in userspace), therefore memory violations lead to instability and system crashes.[12]: 20 

Linux implements virtual memory with 4 and 5-levels page tables. As said, only user memory space is always pageable. It maintains information about each page frame of RAM in apposite data structures (of type struct page) that are populated immediately after boots and that are kept until shutdown, regardless of them being or not associated with virtual pages. Furthermore, it classifies all page frames in zones, according to their architecture dependent constraints and intended use. For example, pages reserved for DMA operations are in ZONE_DMA, pages that are not permanently mapped to virtual addresses are in ZONE_HIGHMEM (in x86_32 architecture this zone is for physical addresses above 896 MB, while x86_64 does not need it because x86_64 can permanently map physical pages that reside in higher addresses), and all that remains (with the exception of other less used classifications) is in ZONE_NORMAL.

Small chunks of memory can be dynamically allocated via the family of kmalloc() APIs and freed with the appropriate variant of kfree(). vmalloc() and kvfree() are used for large virtually contiguous chunks. alloc_pages() allocates the desired number of entire pages.
The Linux Storage Stack Diagram[190]

The kernel includes the SLAB, SLUB and SLOB allocators as configurable alternatives.[191][192] SLUB is the newest and it is also the default allocator. It aims for simplicity and efficiency,[192] and is PREEMPT_RT compatible.[193] The SLOB allocator was later removed in Linux 6.4,[194] with the SLAB allocator planning on being removed in Linux 6.5, leaving the sole remaining allocator to be SLUB, an allocator that has been available since Linux 2.6.[195]

While not originally designed to be portable,[22][196] Linux is now one of the most widely ported operating system kernels, running on a diverse range of systems from the ARM architecture to IBM z/Architecture mainframe computers. The first port was performed on the Motorola 68000 platform. The modifications to the kernel were so fundamental that Torvalds viewed the Motorola version as a fork and a "Linux-like operating system".[196] However, that moved Torvalds to lead a major restructure of the code to facilitate porting to more computing architectures. The first Linux that, in a single source tree, had code for more than i386 alone, supported the DEC Alpha AXP 64-bit platform.[197][198][196]

Linux runs as the main operating system on IBM's Summit; as of October 2019, all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers run some operating system based on the Linux kernel,[13] a big change from 1998 when the first Linux supercomputer got added to the list.[199]

Linux has also been ported to various handheld devices such as Apple's iPhone 3G and iPod.[200]
Supported devices

In 2007, the LKDDb project has been started to build a comprehensive database of hardware and protocols known by Linux kernels.[201] The database is built automatically by static analysis of the kernel sources. Later in 2014, the Linux Hardware project was launched to automatically collect a database of all tested hardware configurations with the help of users of various Linux distributions.[202]
Live patching
	
This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.
Last update: April 2015 (September 2023)

Rebootless updates can even be applied to the kernel by using live patching technologies such as Ksplice, kpatch and kGraft. Minimalistic foundations for live kernel patching were merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 4.0, which was released on 12 April 2015. Those foundations, known as livepatch and based primarily on the kernel's ftrace functionality, form a common core capable of supporting hot patching by both kGraft and kpatch, by providing an application programming interface (API) for kernel modules that contain hot patches and an application binary interface (ABI) for the userspace management utilities. However, the common core included into Linux kernel 4.0 supports only the x86 architecture and does not provide any mechanisms for ensuring function-level consistency while the hot patches are applied. As of April 2015, there is ongoing work on porting kpatch and kGraft to the common live patching core provided by the Linux kernel mainline.[203][204][205]
Security

Kernel bugs present potential security issues. For example, they may allow for privilege escalation or create denial-of-service attack vectors. Over the years, numerous bugs affecting system security were found and fixed.[206] New features are frequently implemented to improve the kernel's security.[207][208]

Capabilities(7) have already been introduced in the section about the processes and threads. Android makes use of them and systemd gives administrators detailed control over the capabilities of processes.[209]

Linux offers a wealth of mechanisms to reduce kernel attack surface and improve security which are collectively known as the Linux Security Modules (LSM).[210] They comprise the Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) module, whose code has been originally developed and then released to the public by the NSA,[211] and AppArmor[94] among others. SELinux is now actively developed and maintained on GitHub.[93] SELinux and AppArmor provide support to access control security policies, including mandatory access control (MAC), though they profoundly differ in complexity and scope.

Another security feature is the Seccomp BPF (SECure COMPuting with Berkeley Packet Filters) which works by filtering parameters and reducing the set of system calls available to user-land applications.[212]

Critics have accused kernel developers of covering up security flaws, or at least not announcing them; in 2008, Linus Torvalds responded to this with the following:[213][214]

    I personally consider security bugs to be just "normal bugs". I don't cover them up, but I also don't have any reason what-so-ever to think it's a good idea to track them and announce them as something special...one reason I refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that I think it glorifies—and thus encourages—the wrong behavior. It makes "heroes" out of security people, as if the people who don't just fix normal bugs aren't as important. In fact, all the boring normal bugs are way more important, just because there's[sic] a lot more of them. I don't think some spectacular security hole should be glorified or cared about as being any more "special" than a random spectacular crash due to bad locking.

Linux distributions typically release security updates to fix vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. Many offer long-term support releases that receive security updates for a certain Linux kernel version for an extended period of time.

Corporate affiliation of contributions to the Linux kernel, 4.8–4.13[216]
Developer community

The community of Linux kernel developers comprises about 5000–6000 members. According to the "2017 State of Linux Kernel Development", a study issued by the Linux Foundation, covering the commits for the releases 4.8 to 4.13, about 1500 developers were contributing from about 200–250 companies on average. The top 30 developers contributed a little more than 16% of the code. For companies, the top contributors are Intel (13.1%) and Red Hat (7.2%), Linaro (5.6%), IBM (4.1%), the second and fifth places are held by the 'none' (8.2%) and 'unknown' (4.1%) categories.[216]

    Instead of a roadmap, there are technical guidelines. Instead of a central resource allocation, there are persons and companies who all have a stake in the further development of the Linux kernel, quite independently from one another: People like Linus Torvalds and I don’t plan the kernel evolution. We don’t sit there and think up the roadmap for the next two years, then assign resources to the various new features. That's because we don’t have any resources. The resources are all owned by the various corporations who use and contribute to Linux, as well as by the various independent contributors out there. It's those people who own the resources who decide...
    — Andrew Morton, 2005

As with many large open-source software projects, developers are required to adhere to the Contributor Covenant, a code of conduct intended to address harassment of minority contributors.[217][218] Additionally, to prevent offense the use of inclusive terminology within the source code is mandated.[219]
Source code management

The Linux development community uses Git to manage the source code. Git users clone the latest version of Torvalds' tree with git-clone(1)[220] and keep it up to date using git-pull(1).[221][222] Contributions are submitted as patches, in the form of text messages on the LKML (and often also on other mailing lists dedicated to particular subsystems). The patches must conform to a set of rules and to a formal language that, among other things, describes which lines of code are to be deleted and what others are to be added to the specified files. These patches can be automatically processed so that system administrators can apply them in order to make just some changes to the code or to incrementally upgrade to the next version.[223] Linux is distributed also in GNU zip (gzip) and bzip2 formats.
Submitting code to the kernel

A developer who wants to change the Linux kernel starts with developing and testing that change. Depending on how significant the change is and how many subsystems it modifies, the change will either be submitted as a single patch or in multiple patches of source code. In case of a single subsystem that is maintained by a single maintainer, these patches are sent as e-mails to the maintainer of the subsystem with the appropriate mailing list in Cc. The maintainer and the readers of the mailing list will review the patches and provide feedback. Once the review process has finished the subsystem maintainer accepts the patches in the relevant Git kernel tree. If the changes to the Linux kernel are bug fixes that are considered important enough, a pull request for the patches will be sent to Torvalds within a few days. Otherwise, a pull request will be sent to Torvalds during the next merge window. The merge window usually lasts two weeks and starts immediately after the release of the previous kernel version.[224] The Git kernel source tree names all developers who have contributed to the Linux kernel in the Credits directory and all subsystem maintainers are listed in Maintainers.[225]
Programming language and coding style
See also: Rust for Linux

Linux is written in a special C programming language supported by GCC, a compiler that extends the C standard in many ways, for example using inline sections of code written in the assembly language (in GCC's "AT&T-style" syntax) of the target architecture. Since 2002 all the code must adhere to the 21 rules comprising the Linux Kernel Coding Style.[226][227]

In September 2021, the GCC version requirement for compiling and building the Linux kernel increased from GCC 4.9 to 5.1, allowing the potential for the kernel to be moved from using C code based on the C89 standard to using code written with the C11 standard,[228] with the migration to the standard taking place in March 2022, with the release of Linux 5.18.[229]

Initial support for the Rust programming language was added in Linux 6.1[5] which was released in December 2022,[230] with later kernel versions, such as Linux 6.2 and Linux 6.3, further improving the support.[231][232]
GNU toolchain

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC or GNU cc) is the default compiler for the mainline Linux sources and it is invoked by a utility called make. Then, the GNU Assembler (more often called GAS or GNU as) outputs the object files from the GCC generated assembly code. Finally, the GNU Linker (GNU ld) is used to produce a statically linked executable kernel file called vmlinux. Both as and ld are part of GNU Binary Utilities (binutils). The above-mentioned tools are collectively known as the GNU toolchain.
Compiler compatibility

GCC was for a long time the only compiler capable of correctly building Linux. In 2004, Intel claimed to have modified the kernel so that its C compiler was also capable of compiling it.[233] There was another such reported success in 2009, with a modified 2.6.22 version.[234][235] Support for the Intel compiler has been dropped in 2023.[236]

Since 2010, effort has been underway to build Linux with Clang, an alternative compiler for the C language;[237] as of 12 April 2014, the official kernel could almost be compiled by Clang.[238][239] The project dedicated to this effort is named LLVMLinux after the LLVM compiler infrastructure upon which Clang is built.[240] LLVMLinux does not aim to fork either Linux or the LLVM, therefore it is a meta-project composed of patches that are eventually submitted to the upstream projects. By enabling Linux to be compiled by Clang, developers may benefit from shorter compilation times.[241]

In 2017, developers completed upstreaming patches to support building the Linux kernel with Clang in the 4.15 release, having backported support for X86-64 and AArch64 to the 4.4, 4.9, and 4.14 branches of the stable kernel tree. Google's Pixel 2 shipped with the first Clang built Linux kernel,[242] though patches for Pixel (1st generation) did exist.[243] 2018 saw ChromeOS move to building kernels with Clang by default,[244] while Android (operating system) made Clang[245] and LLVM's linker LLD[246] required for kernel builds in 2019. Google moved its production kernel used throughout its datacenters to being built with Clang in 2020.[247] Today, the ClangBuiltLinux group coordinates fixes to both Linux and LLVM to ensure compatibility, both composed of members from LLVMLinux and having upstreamed patches from LLVMLinux.
Kernel debugging
Main articles: KGDB, Kernel panic, and Linux kernel oops
An example of Linux kernel panic

Bugs involving the Linux Kernel can be difficult to troubleshoot. This is because of the kernel's interaction with userspace and hardware; and also because they might be caused from a wider range of reasons compared to those of user programs. A few examples of the underlying causes are semantic errors in code, misuse of synchronization primitives, and incorrect hardware management.[12]: 364 

A report of a non-fatal bug in the kernel is called an "oops"; such deviations from correct behavior of the Linux kernel may allow continued operation with compromised reliability.[248]

A critical and fatal error is reported via the panic() function. It prints a message and then halts the kernel.[12]: 371 

One of the most common techniques used to find out bugs in code is debugging by printing. For this purpose Linux provides an in-kernel API called printk() which stores messages in a circular buffer. The syslog(2) system call is used for reading and/or clearing the kernel message ring buffer and for setting the maximum log level of the messages to be sent to the console (i.e., one of the eight KERN_* parameters of printk(), which tell the severity of the condition reported); usually it is invoked via the glibC wrapper klogctl(3).[249] Kernel messages are also exported to userland through the /dev/kmsg interface[250] (e.g., systemd-journald[251][252] reads that interface and by default append the messages to /var/log/journal).

Another fundamental technique for debugging a running kernel is tracing. The ftrace mechanism is a Linux internal tracer; it is used for monitoring and debugging Linux at runtime and it can also analyze user space latencies due to kernel misbehavior.[253][254][255][256] Furthermore, ftrace allows users to trace Linux at boot-time.[257]

kprobes and kretprobes can break (like debuggers in userspace) into Linux and non-disruptively collect information.[258] kprobes can be inserted into code at (almost) any address, while kretprobes work at function return. uprobes have similar purposes but they also have some differences in usage and implementation.[259]

With KGDB Linux can be debugged in much the same way as userspace programs. KGDB requires an additional machine that runs GDB and that is connected to the target to be debugged using a serial cable or Ethernet.[260]
Development model

The Linux kernel project integrates new code on a rolling basis. Software checked into the project must work and compile without error. Each kernel subsystem is assigned a maintainer who is responsible for reviewing patches against the kernel code standards and keeps a queue of patches that can be submitted to Linus Torvalds within a merge window of several weeks. Patches are merged by Torvalds into the source code of the prior stable Linux kernel release, creating the -rc release candidate for the next stable kernel. Once the merge window is closed only fixes to the new code in the development release are accepted. The -rc development release of the kernel goes through regression tests and once it is judged to be stable by Torvalds and the kernel subsystem maintainers a new Linux kernel is released and the development process starts all over again.[261]

Developers who feel treated unfairly can report this to the Linux Foundation's Technical Advisory Board.[262] In July 2013, the maintainer of the USB 3.0 driver Sage Sharp asked Torvalds to address the abusive commentary in the kernel development community. In 2014, Sharp backed out of Linux kernel development, saying that "The focus on technical excellence, in combination with overloaded maintainers, and people with different cultural and social norms, means that Linux kernel maintainers are often blunt, rude, or brutal to get their job done".[263] At the linux.conf.au (LCA) conference in 2018, developers expressed the view that the culture of the community has gotten much better in the past few years. Daniel Vetter, the maintainer of the Intel drm/i915 graphics kernel driver, commented that the "rather violent language and discussion" in the kernel community has decreased or disappeared.[264]

Laurent Pinchart asked developers for feedback on their experience with the kernel community at the 2017 Embedded Linux Conference Europe. The issues brought up were discussed a few days later at the Maintainers Summit. Concerns over the lack of consistency in how maintainers responded to patches submitted by developers were echoed by Shuah Khan, the maintainer of the kernel self-test framework. Torvalds contended that there would never be consistency in the handling of patches because different kernel subsystems have, over time, adopted different development processes. Therefore, it was agreed upon that each kernel subsystem maintainer would document the rules for patch acceptance.[265]
Mainline Linux

The Git tree of Linus Torvalds that contains the Linux kernel is referred to as mainline Linux. Every stable kernel release originates from the mainline tree,[266] and is frequently published on kernel.org. Mainline Linux has only solid support for a small subset of the many devices that run Linux. Non-mainline support is provided by independent projects, such as Yocto or Linaro, but in many cases the kernel from the device vendor is needed.[267] Using a vendor kernel likely requires a board support package.

Maintaining a kernel tree outside of mainline Linux has proven to be difficult.[268]

Mainlining refers to the effort of adding support for a device to the mainline kernel,[269] while there was formerly only support in a fork or no support at all. This usually includes adding drivers or device tree files. When this is finished, the feature or security fix is considered mainlined.[270]
Linux-like kernel

The maintainer of the stable branch, Greg Kroah-Hartman, has applied the term Linux-like to downstream kernel forks by vendors that add millions of lines of code to the mainline kernel.[271] In 2019, Google stated that they wanted to use the mainline Linux kernel in Android so the number of kernel forks would be reduced.[272] The term Linux-like has also been applied to the Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset, which does not include the full mainline Linux kernel but a small modified subset of the code.[273]
Linux forks
An iPod booting iPodLinux

There are certain communities that develop kernels based on the official Linux. Some interesting bits of code from these forks that include Linux-libre, Compute Node Linux, INK, L4Linux, RTLinux, and User-Mode Linux (UML) have been merged into the mainline.[274] Some operating systems developed for mobile phones initially used heavily modified versions of Linux, including Google Android, Firefox OS, HP webOS, Nokia Maemo and Jolla Sailfish OS. In 2010, the Linux community criticised Google for effectively starting its own kernel tree:[275][276]

    This means that any drivers written for Android hardware platforms, can not get merged into the main kernel tree because they have dependencies on code that only lives in Google's kernel tree, causing it to fail to build in the kernel.org tree. Because of this, Google has now prevented a large chunk of hardware drivers and platform code from ever getting merged into the main kernel tree. Effectively creating a kernel branch that a number of different vendors are now relying on.[277]
    — Greg Kroah-Hartman, 2010

Today Android uses a customized Linux[278] where major changes are implemented in device drivers, but some changes to the core kernel code is required. Android developers also submit patches to the official Linux that finally can boot the Android operating system. For example, a Nexus 7 can boot and run the mainline Linux.[278]

At a 2001 presentation at the Computer History Museum, Linus Torvalds had this to say in response to a question about distributions of Linux using precisely the same kernel sources or not:

    They're not... well they are, and they're not. There is no single kernel. Every single distribution has their own changes. That's been going on since pretty much day one. I don't know if you may remember Yggdrasil was known for having quite extreme changes to the kernel and even today all of the major vendors have their own tweaks because they have some portion of the market they're interested in and quite frankly that's how it should be. Because if everybody expects one person, me, to be able to track everything that's not the point of GPL. That's not the point of having an open system. So actually the fact that a distribution decides that something is so important to them that they will add patches for even when it's not in the standard kernel, that's a really good sign for me. So that's for example how something like ReiserFS got added. And the reason why ReiserFS is the first journaling filesystem that was integrated in the standard kernel was not because I love Hans Reiser. It was because SUSE actually started shipping with ReiserFS as their standard kernel, which told me "ok." This is actually in production use. Normal People are doing this. They must know something I don't know. So in a very real sense what a lot of distribution houses do, they are part of this "let's make our own branch" and "let's make our changes to this." And because of the GPL, I can take the best portions of them.[279]
    — Linus Torvalds, 2001

Development community conflicts

There have been several notable conflicts among Linux kernel developers. Examples of such conflicts are:

    In July 2007, Con Kolivas announced that he would cease developing for the Linux kernel.[280][281]
    In July 2009, Alan Cox quit his role as the TTY layer maintainer after disagreement with Linus Torvalds.[282]
    In December 2010, there was a discussion between Linux SCSI maintainer James Bottomley and SCST maintainer Vladislav Bolkhovitin about which SCSI target stack should be included in the Linux kernel.[283] This made some Linux users upset.[284]
    In June 2012, Torvalds made it very clear that he did not agree with NVIDIA releasing its drivers as closed.[285]
    In April 2014, Torvalds banned Kay Sievers from submitting patches to the Linux kernel for failing to deal with bugs that caused systemd to negatively interact with the kernel.[286]
    In October 2014, Lennart Poettering accused Torvalds of tolerating the rough discussion style on Linux kernel related mailing lists and of being a bad role model.[287]
    In March 2015, Christoph Hellwig filed a lawsuit against VMware for infringement of the copyright on the Linux kernel.[288] Linus Torvalds made it clear that he did not agree with this and similar initiatives by calling lawyers a festering disease.[289]
    In April 2021, a team from the University of Minnesota was found to be submitting "bad faith" patches to the kernel as part of their research. This resulted in the immediate reversion of all patches ever submitted by a member of the university. In addition, a warning was issued by a senior maintainer that any future patch from the university would be rejected on sight.[290][291]

Prominent Linux kernel developers have been aware of the importance of avoiding conflicts between developers.[292] For a long time there was no code of conduct for kernel developers due to opposition by Linus Torvalds.[293] However, a Linux Kernel Code of Conflict was introduced on 8 March 2015.[294] It was replaced on 16 September 2018 by a new Code of Conduct based on the Contributor Covenant. This coincided with a public apology by Torvalds and a brief break from kernel development.[295][296] On 30 November 2018, complying with the Code of Conduct, Jarkko Sakkinen of Intel sent out patches replacing instances of "fuck" appearing in source code comments with suitable versions focused on the word 'hug'.[297]
Codebase

As of 2021, the 5.11 release of the Linux kernel had around 30.34 million lines of code. Roughly 14% of the code is part of the "core" (arch, kernel and mm directories), while 60% is drivers.

    Linux is evolution, not intelligent design!
    — Linus Torvalds, 2005[298][299][300]

Estimated cost to redevelop
Redevelopment costs of Linux kernel

The cost to redevelop version 2.6.0 of the Linux kernel in a traditional proprietary development setting has been estimated to be US$612 million (€467M, £394M) in 2004 prices using the COCOMO person-month estimation model.[301] In 2006, a study funded by the European Union put the redevelopment cost of kernel version 2.6.8 higher, at €882M ($1.14bn, £744M).[302]

This topic was revisited in October 2008 by Amanda McPherson, Brian Proffitt, and Ron Hale-Evans. Using David A. Wheeler's methodology, they estimated redevelopment of the 2.6.25 kernel now costs $1.3bn (part of a total $10.8bn to redevelop Fedora 9).[303] Again, Garcia-Garcia and Alonso de Magdaleno from University of Oviedo (Spain) estimate that the value annually added to kernel was about €100M between 2005 and 2007 and €225M in 2008, it would cost also more than €1bn (about $1.4bn as of February 2010) to develop in the European Union.[304]

As of 7 March 2011, using then-current LOC (lines of code) of a 2.6.x Linux kernel and wage numbers with David A. Wheeler's calculations it would cost approximately $3bn (about €2.2bn) to redevelop the Linux kernel as it keeps getting bigger. An updated calculation as of 26 September 2018, using then-current 20,088,609 LOC (lines of code) for the 4.14.14 Linux kernel and the current US national average programmer salary of $75,506 show it would cost approximately $14,725,449,000 dollars (£11,191,341,000) to rewrite the existing code.[305]
Maintenance and long-term support
Boot messages of a Linux kernel 2.6.25.17

The latest kernel version and older kernel versions are maintained separately. Most latest kernel releases were supervised by Linus Torvalds.[306]

The Linux kernel developer community maintains a stable kernel by applying fixes for software bugs that have been discovered during the development of the subsequent stable kernel. Therefore, www.kernel.org will always list two stable kernels. The next stable Linux kernel is now released only 8 to 12 weeks later. Therefore, the Linux kernel maintainers have designated some stable kernel releases as longterm, these long-term support Linux kernels are updated with bug fixes for two or more years.[307] As of February 2022, there are six longterm Linux kernels: 5.15.23, 5.10.100, 5.4.179, 4.19.229, 4.14.266, and 4.9.301.[308] The full list of releases is at Linux kernel version history.
Relation with Linux distributions

Most Linux users run a kernel supplied by their Linux distribution. Some distributions ship the "vanilla" or "stable" kernels. However, several Linux distribution vendors (such as Red Hat and Debian) maintain another set of Linux kernel branches which are integrated into their products. These are usually updated at a slower pace compared to the "vanilla" branch, and they usually include all fixes from the relevant "stable" branch, but at the same time they can also add support for drivers or features which had not been released in the "vanilla" version the distribution vendor started basing their branch from.
Legal aspects
Licensing terms

Initially, Torvalds released Linux under a license which forbade any commercial use.[309] This was changed in version 0.12 by a switch to the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2).[28] This license allows distribution and sale of possibly modified and unmodified versions of Linux but requires that all those copies be released under the same license and be accompanied by - or that, on request, free access is given to - the complete corresponding source code.[310] Torvalds has described licensing Linux under the GPLv2 as the "best thing I ever did".[309]

The Linux kernel is licensed explicitly under GNU General Public License version 2 only (GPL-2.0-only) with an explicit syscall exception (Linux-syscall-note),[6][9][10] without offering the licensee the option to choose any later version, which is a common GPL extension. Contributed code must be available under GPL-compatible license.[11][105]

There was considerable debate about how easily the license could be changed to use later GPL versions (including version 3), and whether this change is even desirable.[311] Torvalds himself specifically indicated upon the release of version 2.4.0 that his own code is released only under version 2.[312] However, the terms of the GPL state that if no version is specified, then any version may be used,[313] and Alan Cox pointed out that very few other Linux contributors had specified a particular version of the GPL.[314]

In September 2006, a survey of 29 key kernel programmers indicated that 28 preferred GPLv2 to the then-current GPLv3 draft. Torvalds commented, "I think a number of outsiders... believed that I personally was just the odd man out because I've been so publicly not a huge fan of the GPLv3."[315] This group of high-profile kernel developers, including Torvalds, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Andrew Morton, commented on mass media about their objections to the GPLv3.[316] They referred to clauses regarding DRM/tivoization, patents, "additional restrictions" and warned a Balkanisation of the "Open Source Universe" by the GPLv3.[316][317] Linus Torvalds, who decided not to adopt the GPLv3 for the Linux kernel, reiterated his criticism even years later.[318]
Loadable kernel modules

It is debated whether some loadable kernel modules (LKMs) are to be considered derivative works under copyright law, and thereby whether or not they fall under the terms of the GPL.

In accordance with the license rules, LKMs using only a public subset of the kernel interfaces[130][131] are non-derived works, thus Linux gives system administrators the mechanisms to load out-of-tree binary objects into the kernel address space.[11]

There are some out-of-tree loadable modules that make legitimate use of the dma_buf kernel feature.[319] GPL compliant code can certainly use it. However, a different possible use case would be Nvidia Optimus that pairs a fast GPU with an Intel integrated GPU, where the Nvidia GPU writes into the Intel framebuffer when it is active. But, Nvidia cannot use this infrastructure because it necessitates bypassing a rule that can only be used by LKMs that are also GPL.[132] Alan Cox replied on LKML, rejecting a request from one of their engineers to remove this technical enforcement from the API.[320] Torvalds clearly stated on the LKML that "[I] claim that binary-only kernel modules ARE derivative "by default"'".[321]

On the other hand, Torvalds has also said that "[one] gray area in particular is something like a driver that was originally written for another operating system (i.e., clearly not a derived work of Linux in origin). THAT is a gray area, and _that_ is the area where I personally believe that some modules may be considered to not be derived works simply because they weren't designed for Linux and don't depend on any special Linux behaviour".[322] Proprietary graphics drivers, in particular, are heavily discussed.

Whenever proprietary modules are loaded into Linux, the kernel marks itself as being "tainted",[323] and therefore bug reports from tainted kernels will often be ignored by developers.

The official kernel, that is the Linus git branch at the kernel.org repository, contains binary blobs released under the terms of the GNU GPLv2 license.[6][11] Linux can also search filesystems to locate binary blobs, proprietary firmware, drivers, or other executable modules, then it can load and link them into kernel space.[324]

When it is needed (e.g., for accessing boot devices or for speed) firmware can be built-in to the kernel, this means building the firmware into vmlinux; however this is not always a viable option for technical or legal issues (e.g., it is not permitted to do this with firmware that is non-GPL compatible, although this is quite common nonetheless).[325]
Trademark

Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the United States, the European Union, and some other countries.[326][327] A legal battle over the trademark began in 1996, when William Della Croce, a lawyer who was never involved in the development of Linux, started requesting licensing fees for the use of the word Linux. After it was proven that the word was in common use long before Della Croce's claimed first use, the trademark was awarded to Torvalds.[328][329][330] 

Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Devices include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Vision Pro, and Apple TV; operating systems include iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and software applications and services include iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.

For most of 2011 to 2024, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization until Microsoft assumed the position in January 2024.[6][7] In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion.[8][failed verification] As of 2023, Apple was the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales,[9] the largest manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world.[10] It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.

Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.

In 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs's return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the "Think different" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.

Apple has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor practices, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, it has a large following and a high level of brand loyalty. It has been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.

Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.[11]
History

1976–1980: Founding and incorporation
See also: History of Apple Inc. § 1971–1985: Jobs and Wozniak
In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple in Jobs's parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[12] Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage "a bit of a myth",[13] although they moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[14]
The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without the required keyboard, monitor, power supply, and the optional case.
The Apple II Plus was introduced in 1979, designed primarily by Wozniak.

Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[12][15] The company's first product is the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[16] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[17]: 57  Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[18] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which was not yet marketed as a complete personal computer.[19] It was priced soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[20][21]: 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".[22]

Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[23][24] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[25] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[26] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to US$118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[27]

The Apple II, also designed by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[28] It differs from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, which were superseded by the 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[29][30]

The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer application" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[29] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[29] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[31][32]

On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol "AAPL") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022),[24] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[33] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, including Jobs and Wozniak, from a stock price of $29 per share[34] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[33][34]
1980–1990: Success with Macintosh
See also: List of Mac models and Timeline of the Apple II family
The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.

In December 1979, Steve Jobs and Apple employees, including Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC, where they observed the Xerox Alto, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI). Apple subsequently negotiated access to PARC's technology, leading to Apple's option to buy shares at a preferential rate. This visit influenced Jobs to implement a GUI in Apple's products, starting with the Apple Lisa. Despite being pioneering as a mass-marketed GUI computer, the Lisa suffered from high costs and limited software options, leading to commercial failure.

Jobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[35] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[36]

In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language.[37] Its debut was signified by "1984", a US$1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[38] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[39] and was called a "masterpiece" by CNN[40] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide.[41]

The advertisement created great interest in Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had required 128 kilobytes of RAM, which limited its speed and software in favor of aspiring for a projected price point of $1,000 (equivalent to $2,900 in 2023). The Macintosh shipped for $2,495 (equivalent to $7,300 in 2023), a price panned by critics due to its slow performance.[42]: 195  In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[43] saying, "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?"[44] Sculley removed Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[45]

The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from leadership.[46] Jean-Louis Gassée informed Sculley that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[46] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took several Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[47] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had "been going in the wrong direction for the last five years".[36][48][49] Wozniak remained employed by Apple as a representative,[48] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year.[21] Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders following their departures.[50]

After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak in 1985, Sculley launched the Macintosh 512K that year with quadruple the RAM, and introduced the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[51] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[52]

This dominant position in the desktop publishing market[53] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called "high-right policy" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, due to Jean-Louis Gassée's slogan of "fifty-five or die", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[54]: 79–80 

This policy began to backfire late in the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on IBM PC compatibles with some of the same functionality of the Macintosh at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford Apple products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[54]: 117–129  During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[55] Gassée left the company later that year.[56]
1990–1997: Decline and restructuring

The company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[57] In 1991, Apple introduced the hugely successful PowerBook with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the Macintosh operating system, adding color to the interface and introducing new networking capabilities.

The success of the lower-cost Macs and PowerBook brought increasing revenue.[58] For some time, Apple was doing very well, introducing fresh new products at increasing profits. The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.[59]
The PenLite is Apple's first tablet computer prototype, created in 1992 to bring the Mac OS to a tablet. It was canceled in favor of the Newton.[60]

The success of lower-cost consumer Macs, especially the LC, cannibalized higher-priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points, for different markets: the high-end Quadra series, the mid-range Centris series, and the consumer-marketed Performa series. This led to significant consumer confusion between so many models.[61]

In the early 1990s, the Apple II series was discontinued. It was expensive to produce, and the company decided it was still absorbing sales from lower-cost Macintosh models. After the launch of the LC, Apple encouraged developers to create applications for Macintosh rather than Apple II, and authorized salespersons to redirect consumers from Apple II and toward Macintosh.[62] The Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.[63]

Apple experimented with several other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including QuickTake digital cameras, PowerCD portable CD audio players, speakers, the Pippin video game console, the eWorld online service, and Apple Interactive Television Box. Enormous resources were invested in the problematic Newton tablet division, based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.[64]

Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to inexpensive personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[65] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; it sued Microsoft for making a GUI similar to the Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.[66] The lawsuit dragged on for years and was finally dismissed.

The major product flops and the rapid loss of market share to Windows sullied Apple's reputation, and in 1993 Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[67]

Under Spindler, Apple, IBM, and Motorola formed the AIM alliance in 1994 to create a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform or PReP), with IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter the dominance of Windows. That year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many computers with Motorola's PowerPC processor.[68]

In the wake of the alliance, Apple opened up to the idea of allowing Motorola and other companies to build Macintosh clones. Over the next two years, 75 distinct Macintosh clone models were introduced. However, by 1996, Apple executives were worried that the clones were cannibalizing sales of its own high-end computers, where profit margins were highest.[69]

In 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO, who was hired for his reputation as a corporate rehabilitator. Amelio made deep changes, including extensive layoffs and cost-cutting.[70]

This period was also marked by numerous failed attempts to modernize the Macintosh operating system (MacOS). The original Macintosh operating system (System 1) was not built for multitasking (running several applications at once). The company attempted to correct this by introducing cooperative multitasking in System 5, but still decided it needed a more modern approach.[71] This led to the Pink project in 1988, A/UX that year, Copland in 1994, and evaluated the purchase of BeOS in 1996. Talks with Be stalled when the CEO, former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, demanded $300 million instead of Apple's $125 million offer.[72]

Only weeks away from bankruptcy,[73] Apple's board preferred NeXTSTEP and purchased NeXT in late 1996 for $400 million, and retained Steve Jobs.[74]
1997–2007: Return to profitability

The NeXT acquisition was finalized on February 9, 1997,[75] and the board brought Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Jobs staged a boardroom coup that resulted in Amelio's resignation after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses.

The board named Jobs as interim CEO and he immediately reviewed the product lineup. Jobs canceled 70% of models, ending 3,000 jobs and paring to the core of its computer offerings.[76] The next month, in August 1997, Steve Jobs convinced Microsoft to make a $150 million investment in Apple and a commitment to continue developing Mac software.[77] This was seen as an "antitrust insurance policy" for Microsoft which had recently settled with the Department of Justice over anti-competitive practices in the United States v. Microsoft Corp. case.[78] Around then, Jobs donated Apple's internal library and archives to Stanford University, to focus more on the present and the future rather than the past.[79][80] He ended the Mac clone deals and in September 1997, purchased the largest clone maker, Power Computing.[81] On November 10, 1997, the Apple Store website launched, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing model similar to PC manufacturer Dell's success.[82]

The moves paid off for Jobs; at the end of his first year as CEO, the company had a $309 million profit.[76]
iMac
iBook
Power Macintosh G3
PowerBook G3

On May 6, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the original Macintosh: the iMac. The iMac was a huge success with 800,000 units sold in its first five months[83] and ushered in major shifts in the industry by abandoning legacy technologies like the 3+1⁄2-inch diskette, being an early adopter of the USB connector, and coming pre-installed with Internet connectivity (the "i" in iMac)[84] via Ethernet and a dial-up modem. Its striking teardrop shape and translucent materials were designed by Jonathan Ive, who had been hired by Amelio, and who collaborated with Jobs for more than a decade to reshape Apple's product design.[85][86]

A little more than a year later on July 21, 1999, Apple introduced the iBook consumer laptop. It culminated Jobs's strategy to produce only four products: refined versions of the Power Macintosh G3 desktop and PowerBook G3 laptop for professionals, and the iMac desktop and iBook laptop for consumers. Jobs said the small product line allowed for a greater focus on quality and innovation.[87]

Around then, Apple also completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital media production software for both professionals and consumers. Apple acquired Macromedia's Key Grip digital video editing software project which was launched as Final Cut Pro in April 1999.[88] Key Grip's development also led to Apple's release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[89] Apple acquired the German company Astarte in April 2000, which had developed the DVD authoring software DVDirector, which Apple repackaged as the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro, and reused its technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[89] In 2000, Apple purchased the SoundJam MP audio player software from Casady & Greene. Apple renamed the program iTunes, and simplified the user interface and added CD burning.[90]

In 2001, Apple changed course with three announcements.

First, on March 24, 2001, Apple announced the release of a new modern operating system, Mac OS X. This was after numerous failed attempts in the early 1990s, and several years of development. Mac OS X is based on NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, and BSD Unix, to combine the stability, reliability, and security of Unix with the ease of use of an overhauled user interface. To aid migration from Mac OS 9, the new operating system ran legacy applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[91]

In May 2001, the first two Apple Store retail locations opened in Virginia and California,[92][93] offering an improved presentation of the company's products.[94] At the time, many speculated that the stores would fail,[95] but they became highly successful, and the first of more than 500 stores around the world.[96]

On October 23, 2001, the iPod portable digital audio player debuted. The product was first sold on November 10, 2001, and was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.[97]

In 2003, the iTunes Store was introduced with music downloads for 99¢ a song and iPod integration. It quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over five billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[98] Two years later, the iTunes Store was the world's largest music retailer.[99]

In 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for its advanced digital compositing application Shake,[100] and Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple's consumer-level GarageBand application.[101] The release of iPhoto that year completed the iLife suite.[102]
The MacBook Pro is Apple's first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, introduced in 2006.

At the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would move away from PowerPC processors, and the Mac would transition to Intel processors in 2006.[103] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[103] The Power Mac, iBook, and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[104] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[105]

Apple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80.[106] When Apple surpassed Dell's market cap in January 2006,[107] Jobs sent an email to Apple employees saying Dell's CEO Michael Dell should eat his words.[108] Nine years prior, Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would "shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders".[109]
2007–2011: Success with mobile devices
The newly announced iPhone was on display at the 2007 MacWorld Expo.

During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the renaming of Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc., because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[110] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[111] and the Apple TV.[112] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[113] and the device was called "a game changer for the industry".[114]

In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management, thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[115] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[116] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[117]

In July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[118] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[119] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[120]

On January 14, 2009, Jobs announced in an internal memo that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that "the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well", and explained that the break would allow the company "to focus on delivering extraordinary products".[121] Though Jobs was absent, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16 billion and profit of $1.21 billion.[122]

After years of speculation and multiple rumored "leaks", Apple unveiled a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and all iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, though having very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the U.S. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[123] In May 2010, Apple's market cap exceeded that of competitor Microsoft for the first time since 1989.[124]

In June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[125] which introduced video calling using FaceTime, multitasking, and a new design with an exposed stainless steel frame as the phone's antenna system. Later that year, Apple again refreshed the iPod line by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the clickwheel buttons of earlier generations.[126] It also introduced the smaller, cheaper second generation Apple TV which allowed renting of movies and shows.[127]

On January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence for an indefinite period to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs's day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain "involved in major strategic decisions".[128] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[129] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files, and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple's previous attempt at content syncing.[130] This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death.

On August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[131] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple's chairman. Apple did not have a chairman at the time[132] and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D. Levinson,[133] who continued with those titles until Levinson replaced Jobs as chairman of the board in November after Jobs's death.[134]
2011–present: Post-Jobs era, Tim Cook

On October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple.[135] The next major product announcement by Apple was on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBook's Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.[136] Jobs stated in the biography "Steve Jobs" that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.[137]

From 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S[138] and iPhone 5,[139] which featured improved cameras, an intelligent software assistant named Siri, and cloud-synced data with iCloud; the third- and fourth-generation iPads, which featured Retina displays;[140][141] and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen.[142] These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders[143] and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth-generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).[144] Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.[141][142][145]

On August 20, 2012, Apple's rising stock price increased the company's market capitalization to a then-record $624 billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization previously set by Microsoft in 1999.[146] On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05 billion (£665m) in damages in an intellectual property lawsuit.[147] Samsung appealed the damages award, which was reduced by $450 million[148] and further granted Samsung's request for a new trial.[148] On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that dismissed all existing lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.[149] It is predicted that Apple will make US$280 million per year from this deal with HTC.[150]

In May 2014, Apple confirmed its intent to acquire Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine's audio company Beats Electronics—producer of the "Beats by Dr. Dre" line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music—for US$3 billion, and to sell their products through Apple's retail outlets and resellers. Iovine believed that Beats had always "belonged" with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple's "unmatched ability to marry culture and technology." The acquisition was the largest purchase in Apple's history.[151]
Apple Watch first generation (2015)

During a press event on September 9, 2014, Apple introduced a smartwatch called the Apple Watch.[152] Initially, Apple marketed the device as a fashion accessory[153] and a complement to the iPhone, that would allow people to look at their smartphones less.[154] Over time, the company has focused on developing health and fitness-oriented features on the watch, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers.

In January 2016, Apple announced that over one billion Apple devices were in active use worldwide.[155]

On June 6, 2016, Fortune released Fortune 500, its list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year of 2015, Apple was listed as the top tech company.[156] It ranked third, overall, with US$233 billion in revenue.[156] This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year's list.[156]

In June 2017, Apple announced the HomePod, its smart speaker aimed to compete against Sonos, Google Home, and Amazon Echo.[157] Toward the end of the year, TechCrunch reported that Apple was acquiring Shazam, a company that introduced its products at WWDC and specializing in music, TV, film and advertising recognition.[158] The acquisition was confirmed a few days later, reportedly costing Apple US$400 million, with media reports that the purchase looked like a move to acquire data and tools bolstering the Apple Music streaming service.[159] The purchase was approved by the European Union in September 2018.[160]

Also in June 2017, Apple appointed Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to head the newly formed worldwide video unit. In November 2017, Apple announced it was branching out into original scripted programming: a drama series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and a reboot of the anthology series Amazing Stories with Steven Spielberg.[161] In June 2018, Apple signed the Writers Guild of America's minimum basic agreement and Oprah Winfrey to a multi-year content partnership.[162] Additional partnerships for original series include Sesame Workshop and DHX Media and its subsidiary Peanuts Worldwide, and a partnership with A24 to create original films.[163]

During the Apple Special Event in September 2017, the AirPower wireless charger was announced alongside the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and Watch Series 3. The AirPower was intended to wirelessly charge multiple devices, simultaneously. Though initially set to release in early 2018, the AirPower would be canceled in March 2019, marking the first cancellation of a device under Cook's leadership.[164]

On August 19, 2020, Apple's share price briefly topped $467.77, making it the first US company with a market capitalization of US$2 trillion.[165]
MacBook Air M1 (2020)

During its annual WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, Apple announced it would move away from Intel processors, and the Mac would transition to processors developed in-house.[166] The announcement was expected by industry analysts, and it has been noted that Macs featuring Apple's processors would allow for big increases in performance over current Intel-based models.[167] On November 10, 2020, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the Mac Mini became the first Mac devices powered by an Apple-designed processor, the Apple M1.[168]

In April 2022, it was reported that Samsung Electro-Mechanics would be collaborating with Apple on its M2 chip instead of LG Innotek.[169] Developer logs showed that at least nine Mac models with four different M2 chips were being tested.[170]

The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple's effort to develop its own chips left it better prepared to deal with the semiconductor shortage that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased profitability, with sales of M1-based Mac computers rising sharply in 2020 and 2021. It also inspired other companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms to pursue a similar path.[171]

In April 2022, Apple opened an online store that allowed anyone in the US to view repair manuals and order replacement parts for specific recent iPhones, although the difference in cost between this method and official repair is anticipated to be minimal.[172]

In May 2022, a trademark was filed for RealityOS, an operating system reportedly intended for virtual and augmented reality headsets, first mentioned in 2017. According to Bloomberg, the headset may come out in 2023.[173] Further insider reports state that the device uses iris scanning for payment confirmation and signing into accounts.[174]

On June 18, 2022, the Apple Store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the U.S., with the employees voting to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.[175]

On July 7, 2022, Apple added Lockdown Mode to macOS 13 and iOS 16, as a response to the earlier Pegasus revelations; the mode increases security protections for high-risk users against targeted zero-day malware.[176]

Apple launched a buy now, pay later service called 'Apple Pay Later' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. The program allows its users to apply for loans between $50 and $1,000 to make online or in-app purchases and then repaying them through four installments spread over six weeks without any interest or fees.[177][178]

In November 2023, Apple agreed to a $25 million settlement in a U.S. Department of Justice case that alleged Apple was discriminating against U.S. citizens in hiring. Apple created jobs that were not listed online and required paper submission to apply for, while advertising these jobs to foreign workers as part of recruitment for PERM.[179]

In January 2024, Apple announced compliance with the European Union's competition law, with major changes to the App Store and other services, effective March 7. This enables iOS users in the 27-nation bloc to use alternative app stores, and alternative payment methods within apps. This adds a menu in Safari for downloading alternative browsers, such as Chrome or Firefox.[180]

Macintosh, commonly known as Mac, is Apple's line of personal computers that use the company's proprietary macOS operating system. Personal computers were Apple's original business line, but as of the end of 2023 they account for only about eight percent of the company's revenue.[1]

There are six Macintosh computer families in production:

    iMac: Consumer all-in-one desktop computer, introduced in 1998.
    Mac Mini: Consumer sub-desktop computer, introduced in 2005.
    MacBook Pro: Professional notebook, introduced in 2006.
    Mac Pro: Professional workstation, introduced in 2006.
    MacBook Air: Consumer ultra-thin notebook, introduced in 2008.
    Mac Studio: Professional small form-factor workstation, introduced in 2022.

Often described as a walled garden, Macs use Apple silicon chips, run the macOS operating system, and include Apple software like the Safari web browser, iMovie for home movie editing, GarageBand for music creation, and the iWork productivity suite. Apple also sells pro apps: Final Cut Pro for video production, Logic Pro for musicians and producers, and Xcode for software developers.

Apple also sells a variety of accessories for Macs, including the Pro Display XDR, Apple Studio Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard.
iPhone

The iPhone is Apple's line of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new models have been released every year. When it was introduced, its multi-touch screen was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy.

iOS is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android. The iPhone has generated large profits for the company, and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies.[181] As of the end of 2023, the iPhone accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.[1]
iPad
Main article: iPad

The iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS. The first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini, upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1 and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited OS.[182][183]

As of September 2020, Apple has sold more than 500 million iPads, though sales peaked in 2013.[184] The iPad still remains the most popular tablet computer by sales as of the second quarter of 2020,[185] and accounted for seven percent of the company's revenue as of the end of 2023.[1]

Apple sells several iPad accessories, including the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, Smart Keyboard Folio, Magic Keyboard, and several adapters.
Other products
AirPods Max
Apple Watch Ultra

Apple makes several other products that it categorizes as "Wearables, Home and Accessories".[186] These products include the AirPods line of wireless headphones, Apple TV digital media players, Apple Watch smartwatches, Beats headphones, HomePod smart speakers, and the Vision Pro mixed reality headset.

As of the end of 2023, this broad line of products comprises about ten percent of the company's revenues.[1]
Services

Apple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.

As of the end of 2023, services comprise about 22% of the company's revenue.[1] In 2019, Apple announced it would be making a concerted effort to expand its service revenues.[187]

Branding
The first official logo of Apple Inc. was used from 1977 to 1998.[188]

According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name "Apple" was "fun, spirited and not intimidating".[189] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[190] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended when they settled their lawsuit in 2007.[191]

Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.[192] On August 27, 1999,[193] Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.[194]

Apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism "something that was stumbled upon,"[195] while Ive claimed in 2014 that "people have an incredibly personal relationship" with Apple's products.[85]

Fortune magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[196] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group's "Best Global Brands" report.[197] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year as of 2005.[198]

As of January 2021, 1.65 billion Apple products were in active use.[199][200] In February 2023, that number exceeded 2 billion devices.[201][202]
Advertising
Main article: Apple Inc. advertising

Apple's first slogan, "Byte into an Apple", was coined in the late 1970s.[203] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan "Think different" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[204] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines—for example, "iThink, therefore iMac" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[205] and "Say hello to iPhone" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[206] "Hello" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac ("hello (again)"), and iPod.[207]

From the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl advertisement to the more modern Get a Mac adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts toward effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[208] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[209] Apple's product advertisements gained significant attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[210] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple advertisements include Canadian singer Feist with the song "1234" and Yael Naïm with the song "New Soul".[210]
Stores

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs,[92] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[94] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.[94] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,[211] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.[92] The media initially speculated that Apple would fail,[95] but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.[95]

Over the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017.[96] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.[212] Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, and changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals.[213]

Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone "flagship" stores in high-profile locations.[94] It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.[214] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.[215] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.[212] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,[212] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.[212]
Market power

On March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012.[216]

On August 13, 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued both Apple and Google after Fortnite was removed from Apple's and Google's App stores. The lawsuits came after Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system that bypassed the fees that Apple and Google had imposed.[217] In September 2020, Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with thirteen other companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores.[218] Later, in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company would not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps and privacy rule changes.[219] Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that "this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it's going to have on small-business owners," commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.[220]
Privacy
PRISM is a clandestine surveillance program under which the NSA collects user data from companies like Facebook and Apple.[221]

Apple has publicly taken a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[222] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[223] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system.[224] It also introduced "differential privacy", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that Wired described as "trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it".[225] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.[226]

However, Apple has aided law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices,[227] and the company's commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models, which do not have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.[228]

With Apple's release of an update to iOS 14, Apple required all developers of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch applications to directly ask iPhone users permission to track them. The feature, called "App Tracking Transparency", received heavy criticism from Facebook, whose primary business model revolves around the tracking of users' data and sharing such data with advertisers so users can see more relevant ads, a technique commonly known as targeted advertising. After Facebook's measures, including purchasing full-page newspaper advertisements protesting App Tracking Transparency, Apple released the update in early 2021. A study by Verizon subsidiary Flurry Analytics reported only 4% of iOS users in the United States and 12% worldwide have opted into tracking.[229]

Prior to the release of iOS 15, Apple announced new efforts at combating child sexual abuse material on iOS and Mac platforms. Parents of minor iMessage users can now be alerted if their child sends or receives nude photographs. Additionally, on-device hashing would take place on media destined for upload to iCloud, and hashes would be compared to a list of known abusive images provided by law enforcement; if enough matches were found, Apple would be alerted and authorities informed. The new features received praise from law enforcement and victims rights advocates, however privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, condemned the new features as invasive and highly prone to abuse by authoritarian governments.[230]

Ireland's Data Protection Commission launched a privacy investigation to examine whether Apple complied with the EU's GDPR law following an investigation into how the company processes personal data with targeted ads on its platform.[231]

In December 2019, security researcher Brian Krebs discovered that the iPhone 11 Pro would still show the arrow indicator –signifying location services are being used– at the top of the screen while the main location services toggle is enabled, despite all individual location services being disabled. Krebs was unable to replicate this behavior on older models and when asking Apple for comment, he was told by Apple that "It is expected behavior that the Location Services icon appears in the status bar when Location Services is enabled. The icon appears for system services that do not have a switch in Settings."[232] Apple later further clarified that this behavior was to ensure compliance with ultra-wideband regulations in specific countries, a technology Apple started implementing in iPhones starting with iPhone 11 Pro, and emphasized that "the management of ultra wideband compliance and its use of location data is done entirely on the device and Apple is not collecting user location data." Will Strafach, an executive at security firm Guardian Firewall, confirmed the lack of evidence that location data was sent off to a remote server. Apple promised to add a new toggle for this feature and in later iOS revisions Apple provided users with the option to tap on the location services indicator in Control Center to see which specific service is using the device's location.[233][234]

According to published reports by Bloomberg News on March 30, 2022, Apple turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, an Apple representative referred the reporter to a section of the company policy for law enforcement guidelines, which stated, "We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse."[235]

Corporate culture
Co-founder Steve Wozniak and Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld attended the Apple User Group Connection club in 1985.
These universities produced the most alumni who became Apple employees.

Apple is one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the "1984" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[253] According to a 2011 report in Fortune, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[254] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[255]

As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[256]

The Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing. Recipients include Bill Atkinson,[257] Steve Capps,[258] Rod Holt,[257] Alan Kay,[259][260] Guy Kawasaki,[259][261] Al Alcorn,[262] Don Norman,[259] Rich Page,[257] Steve Wozniak,[257] and Phil Schiller.[263]

At Apple, employees are intended to be specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise.[needs update] Jobs saw this as a means of having "best-in-class" employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores. This was done by Tim Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management.[264] Apple is known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a "directly responsible individual" or "DRI" in Apple jargon.[254][265] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[266] Unlike other major U.S. companies, Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[267]

In 2015, Apple had 110,000 full-time employees. This increased to 116,000 full-time employees the next year, a notable hiring decrease, largely due to its first revenue decline. Apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail, though its 2014 SEC filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base.[268] In September 2017, Apple announced that it had over 123,000 full-time employees.[269]

Apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy, and has an anti-leak Global Security team that recruits from the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service.[270]

In December 2017, Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.[271]

In 2023, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman revealed the existence of Apple's Exploratory Design Group (XDG), which was working to add glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch. Gurman compared XDG to Alphabet's X "moonshot factory".[272]

Apple Inc.'s world corporate headquarters are located in Cupertino, in the middle of California's Silicon Valley, at Apple Park, a massive circular groundscraper building with a circumference of one mile (1.6 km). The building opened in April 2017 and houses more than 12,000 employees. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted Apple Park to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge, and personally appeared before the Cupertino City Council in June 2011 to make the proposal, in his final public appearance before his death.
The original Apple Campus has the street address 1 Infinite Loop, Sunnyvale, California.

Apple also operates from the Apple Campus (also known by its address, 1 Infinite Loop), a grouping of six buildings in Cupertino that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) located about 1 mile (1.6 km) to the west of Apple Park.[273] The Apple Campus was the company's headquarters from its opening in 1993, until the opening of Apple Park in 2017. The buildings, located at 1–6 Infinite Loop, are arranged in a circular pattern around a central green space, in a design that has been compared to that of a university.

In addition to Apple Park and the Apple Campus, Apple occupies an additional thirty office buildings scattered throughout the city of Cupertino, including three buildings as prior headquarters: Stephens Creek Three from 1977 to 1978, Bandley One from 1978 to 1982, and Mariani One from 1982 to 1993.[274] In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.[275]

Apple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland, called the Hollyhill campus.[276] The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple's first location outside of the United States.[277] Apple's international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.[278]

Apple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100 m2) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon[279] and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000 m2) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and Apple Maps data management.

The company also has several other locations in Boulder, Colorado, Culver City, California, Herzliya (Israel), London, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and Seattle that each employ hundreds of people.[280]
Litigation
Main article: Litigation involving Apple Inc.

Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[281] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include Apple v. Samsung, Apple v. Microsoft, Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc., and Apple Corps v. Apple Computer. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[282] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.[283] Most recently, in November 2017, the United States International Trade Commission announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.[284] In January 2022, Ericsson sued Apple over payment of royalty of 5G technology.[285]
Finances
See also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple

Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue, the world's largest technology company by total assets,[286] and the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung.[287]

In its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion—and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.[288] On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.[289]

The company's worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170 billion.[290] In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the Fortune 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.[291] As of 2016, Apple has around US$234 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.[292]

Apple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity. In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings.[293]

On April 30, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had cash reserves of $250 billion,[294] officially confirmed by Apple as specifically $256.8 billion a few days later.[295]

As of August 3, 2018, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. On August 2, 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach a $1 trillion market value.[296][297] Apple was ranked No. 4 on the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[298]

In July 2022, Apple reported an 11% decline in Q3 profits compared to 2021. Its revenue in the same period rose 2% year-on-year to $83 billion, though this figure was also lower than in 2021, where the increase was at 36%. The general downturn is reportedly caused by the slowing global economy and supply chain disruptions in China.[299]

In May 2023, Apple reported a decline in its sales for the first quarter of 2023. Compared to that of 2022, revenue for 2023 fell by 3%. This is Apple's second consecutive quarter of sales decline. This fall is attributed to the slowing economy and consumers putting off purchases of iPads and computers due to increased pricing. However, iPhone sales held up with a year-on-year increase of 1.5%. According to Apple, demands for such devices were strong, particularly in Latin America and South Asia.[300]
Taxes

Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to The New York Times, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the "Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[301][302]

British Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[303] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporate tax rates. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[304]

According to a US Senate report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.[305] The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years. "Apple has exploited a difference between Irish and U.S. tax residency rules", the report said.[306]

On May 21, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company's tax tactics at a Senate hearing.[307]

Apple says that it is the single largest taxpayer in the U.S., with an effective tax rate of approximately of 26% as of Q2 FY2016.[308] In an interview with the German newspaper FAZ in October 2017, Tim Cook stated that Apple was the biggest taxpayer worldwide.[309]

In 2016, after a two-year investigation, the European Commission claimed that Apple's use of a hybrid Double Irish tax arrangement constituted "illegal state aid" from Ireland, and ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. This was later annulled, after the European General Court ruled that the commission had provided insufficient evidence.[310][311] In 2018, Apple repatriated $285 billion to America, resulting in a $38 billion tax payment spread over the following eight years.[312]

Charity

Apple is a partner of Product Red, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,[313] generating more than US$20 million,[314] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish.[315]

Apple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy,[316] and in 2017 it donated $5 million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey,[317] and for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake.[318] The company has used its iTunes platform to encourage donations in the wake of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[319] the 2011 Japan earthquake,[320] Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013,[321] and the 2015 European migrant crisis.[322] Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.[323]

On April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, "help protect life on our planet." Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[324]

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple's CEO Cook announced that the company will be donating "millions" of masks to health workers in the United States and Europe.[325]

On January 13, 2021, Apple announced a $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to help combat institutional racism worldwide after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.[326][327][328] In June 2023, Apple announced doubling this and then distributed more than $200 million to support organizations focused on education, economic growth, and criminal justice. Half is philanthropic grants and half is centered on equity.[326]

Apple Energy

Apple Energy, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June 6, 2016, Apple's solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[329] Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina to use the methane emissions to generate electricity.[330] Apple's North Carolina data center is already powered entirely by renewable sources.[331]
Energy and resources

In 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category "Striding".[332] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a "stuck icon", adding that Apple at the time was "a choice to avoid for the climate-conscious consumer".[333]

Following a Greenpeace protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.[334][335] By 2013, Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.[336]

In May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, "Apple's commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet."[337]

As of 2016, Apple states that 100% of its U.S. operations run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple's data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.[338] However, the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources, so Apple carbon offsets its electricity use.[339] The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,[340] the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million US gal (2.2 million m3) in 2015.[341]

During an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.[342] Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km2) of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor-made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.[343]

Apple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.[344] Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL's Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills.[345]

On July 21, 2020, Apple announced its plan to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. In the next 10 years, Apple will try to lower emissions with a series of innovative actions, including: low carbon product design, expanding energy efficiency, renewable energy, process and material innovations, and carbon removal.[346]

In April 2021, Apple said that it had started a $200 million fund in order to combat climate change by removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.[347]

In February 2022, the NewClimate Institute, a German environmental policy think tank, published a survey evaluating the transparency and progress of the climate strategies and carbon neutrality pledges announced by 25 major companies in the United States that found that Apple's carbon neutrality pledge and climate strategy was unsubstantiated and misleading.[348][349]

In Russia, in 2022, the company's revenue amounted to 85 billion rubles.[7]

In 2023, Apple announced it was dropping leather from its product lines, citing the material's "significant carbon footprint".[350] The move earned Apple a 2023 Company of the Year award from PETA.[351]
Toxins

Following further campaigns by Greenpeace,[352] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line.[353] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro.[354][355][356][357] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.[358] In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.[354][359] All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.[354][360]

In November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how "green" their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10.[361] Greenpeace praised Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. Apple continues to score well on product ratings, with all of their products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data, and for not setting any targets to reduce emissions.[362] In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[363]
Green bonds

In February 2016, Apple issued a US$1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[364]

Apple products were made in America in Apple-owned factories until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by The New York Times, Apple insiders "believe the vast scale of overseas factories, as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers, have so outpaced their American counterparts that 'Made in the USA' is no longer a viable option for most Apple products".[365]

The company's manufacturing, procurement, and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: "Nobody wants to buy sour milk."[366][367]

In May 2017, the company announced a $1 billion funding project for "advanced manufacturing" in the United States,[368] and subsequently invested $200 million in Corning Inc., a manufacturer of toughened Gorilla Glass technology used in its iPhone devices.[369] The following December, Apple's chief operating officer, Jeff Williams, told CNBC that the "$1 billion" amount was "absolutely not" the final limit on its spending, elaborating that "We're not thinking in terms of a fund limit... We're thinking about, where are the opportunities across the U.S. to help nurture companies that are making the advanced technology— and the advanced manufacturing that goes with that— that quite frankly is essential to our innovation."[370]

As of 2021, Apple uses components from 43 countries.[371] The majority of assembling is done by Taiwanese original design manufacturer firms Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics with factories mostly located inside China,[372] but also Brazil,[373] and India.[374]

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (TSMC) is a pure-play semiconductor manufacturing company. They make the majority of Apple's smartphone SoCs, with Samsung Semiconductor, playing a minority role.[375] Apple, alone accounted for over 25% of TSMC's total income in 2021.[376] Apple's Bionic lineup of smartphone SoCs, are currently made exclusively by TSMC[377] from the A11 bionic onward, previously manufacturing was shared with Samsung. The M series of Apple SoC for consumer computers and tablets is made by TSMC.[378]

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[379] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.[380]

Apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the Indian market. In July 2012, during a conference call with investors, CEO Tim Cook said that he "[loves] India", but that Apple saw larger opportunities outside the region.[381] India's requirement that 30% of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as "really adds cost to getting product to market".[382] In May 2016, Apple opened an iOS app development center in Bangalore and a maps development office for 4,000 staff in Hyderabad.[383] In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would begin manufacturing iPhone models in India "over the next two months",[384] and in May, the Journal wrote that an Apple manufacturer had begun production of iPhone SE in the country,[385] while Apple told CNBC that the manufacturing was for a "small number" of units.[386] In April 2019, Apple initiated manufacturing of iPhone 7 at its Bengaluru facility, keeping in mind demand from local customers even as they seek more incentives from the government of India.[387] At the beginning of 2020, Tim Cook announced that Apple schedules the opening of its first physical outlet in India for 2021, while an online store is to be launched by the end of the year.[388]

During the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Chinese state-owned company Wingtech was reported by The Wall Street Journal to gain an additional foothold in Apple's supply chain following protests at a Foxconn factory in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone.[389]

In 2006, one complex of factories in Shenzhen, China that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.[390][391]

Apple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[392] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker's rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published as of 2008.[393] In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers' child labor practices in China had worsened.[394]

The Foxconn suicides occurred between January and November 2010, when 18 Foxconn (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted suicide,[395] resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.[395][396][397] The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.[398] Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:

    [Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn ... A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.[399]

The statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.[399] Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.[400]

Also in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[401] After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,[402] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[403] Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.[404]

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, after Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. The BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing as of 2010, but Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: "We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions".[400]

In December 2014, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in "primitive, dark and filthy dorms" where they sleep "on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room." Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.[405]

In 2019, there were reports stating that some of Foxconn's managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones and that Apple was investigating the issue.[406] 

ASML Holding N.V. (commonly shortened to ASML, originally standing for Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography) is a Dutch multinational corporation founded in 1984. ASML specializes in the development and manufacturing of photolithography machines which are used to produce computer chips.

As of 2023 it is the largest supplier for the semiconductor industry and the sole supplier in the world of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) photolithography machines that are required to manufacture the most advanced chips.[2] As of March 2024, ASML was the most highly valued European tech company, with a market capitalization of about US$397 billion.[3][4]

ASML's corporate headquarters is in Veldhoven, Netherlands and the location for research, development, manufacturing and assembly. ASML employs more than 39,000 people[1] from 143 nationalities and relies on a network of nearly 5,000 tier 1 suppliers.[5] ASML has a worldwide customer base and over sixty service points in sixteen countries.[5] It has offices in the Netherlands, the United States, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan.[5]

The company is listed on both the AEX and NASDAQ Stock Exchanges, as ASML. It is also a component of the Euro Stoxx 50[6] and NASDAQ-100.[7]

ASML produces the photolithography machines used in the production of computer chips. In these machines, patterns are optically imaged onto a silicon wafer that is covered with a film of light-sensitive material (photoresist). This procedure is repeated dozens of times on a single wafer. The photoresist is then further processed to create the actual electronic circuits on the silicon. The optical imaging that ASML's machines deal with is used in the fabrication of nearly all integrated circuits and, as of 2011, ASML had 67 percent of the worldwide sales of lithography machines.[8]

ASML's competition consisted of Ultratech, Canon and Nikon, MKS Instruments, Lam Research and Cadence Design Systems.[citation needed]
Immersion lithography

Since immersion lithography was first proposed by Burn-Jeng Lin in the 1970s,[9] ASML cooperated with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC). In 2004, TSMC began commercial production of 90 nanometer semiconductor nodes using ASML immersion lithography.[10] As of 2011, their high-end TWINSCAN NXT:1950i system was used for producing features down to 32 nanometres at up to 200 wafers per hour,[11] using a water immersion lens and an argon fluoride laser that produces light at a wavelength of 193 nm. As of 2011, an average lithography machine cost €27 million.[12]
DUV lithography

Deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography devices from ASML use light that penetrates the UV spectrum to print the tiny features that form the microchip's structure.[13]

In 2009, the IMEC research center in Belgium produced the world's first functional 22 nm CMOS Static random-access memory memory cells with a prototype EUV lithography machine.[14] In 2011 series-produced (non-prototype) EUV machines were shipped.[12]
EUV lithography

After decades of development, ASML shipped the first production extreme ultraviolet lithography machine in 2013.[15] These machines produce light in the 13.5 nm wavelength range when a high-energy laser is focused on microscopic droplets of molten tin to produce a plasma, which then emits EUV light. The light is bounced off Zeiss mirrors onto the surface of a silicon wafer to deliver the designs for the chip.[16] ASML's best-selling EUV product has been the TWINSCAN NXE:3600D, which costs up to $200 million.[2] Shipping the machine the size of a truck requires moving 180 tons with three Boeing 747s.[17] As of 2022, ASML has shipped around 140 EUV systems, and it is the only company to manufacture them.[2]

ASML is working on the next generation of EUV systems, with the first shipments to customers for R&D purposes expected to take place at the end of 2023.[15] The platform is designated High-NA as it will increase the numerical aperture (NA) from 0.33 to 0.55,[15] and each system is expected to cost $300 million.[2]
Nanoimprint lithography

In addition to immersion-based lithography and EUV lithography, ASML has a substantial intellectual property portfolio covering imprint lithography.[18]
History

The company, originally named ASM Lithography, is named ASML as its official name and not an abbreviation.[19] It was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between the Dutch companies ASM and Philips. Nowadays it is a public company. When the company became independent in 1988, it was decided that changing the name was not desirable, and the abbreviation ASML became the official company name.[20]

ASML released the lithography system PAS 5500 in 1991, which became an extremely successful platform for the company.[21] The PAS 5500 was first utilized by Micron Technology, which was one of the world's largest producers of computer memory and storage, and ASML's largest customer at that time.[22] The success of the PAS 5500 line propelled ASML into strong competition with Canon and Nikon, who were the leaders in that era of the lithography market.[21]

In 1997, ASML began studying a shift to using extreme ultraviolet and in 1999 joined a consortium including Intel, two other U.S. chipmakers, in order to exploit fundamental research conducted by the US Department of Energy. Because of the CRADA it operates under is funded by the US taxpayer, licensing must be approved by Congress. It collaborated with the Belgian Imec and Sematech and turned to Carl Zeiss in Germany for its need of mirrors.[23]

In 2000, ASML acquired the Silicon Valley Group (SVG), a US lithography equipment manufacturer also licensed for EUV research results, in a bid to supply 193 nm scanners to Intel Corp.[24][25]

In 2002, it became the largest supplier of photolithography systems.[26]

At the end of 2008, ASML experienced a large drop in sales, which led management to cut the workforce by about 1000 worldwide, mostly contract workers[27] and to apply for support from the Dutch national unemployment fund to prevent even larger layoffs.[28] Two and a half years later, ASML expected a record-high revenue.[29]

In July 2012, Intel announced a deal to invest $4.1 billion into ASML in exchange for 15% ownership, in order to speed up the transition from 300 mm to 450 mm wafers and further development of EUV lithography.[30][31] This deal was without exclusive rights to future ASML products and, as of July 2012, ASML was offering another 10% of the shares to other companies.[32] As part of their EUV strategy, ASML announced the acquisition of DUV and EUV sources manufacturer Cymer in October 2012.[33]

In November 2013, ASML paused development of 450 mm lithography equipment, citing uncertain timing of chipmaker demand.[34]

In 2015, ASML suffered intellectual property theft. A number of employees had been found stealing confidential data from its Silicon Valley software subsidiary that develops software for machine optimization.[35]

In June 2016, ASML announced their plans to acquire Taiwan-based Hermes Microvision Inc. for about $3.1 billion to add technology for creating smaller and more advanced semiconductors.[36]

In 2018, the Trump administration tried to block the sale of ASML technology to China,[37] but as of 2021, the 2020–present global chip shortage as well as the "technological cold war" between the US and China has been a business opportunity for ASML.[17]

In November 2020, ASML revealed that it had acquired the German optical glassmaking firm Berliner Glas Group in order to meet increasing need for components for its EUV systems.[38]

In July 2021, Thierry Breton European Commissioner, visited ASML and announced a goal of at least 20% of world production of semiconductors in Europe by 2030, and support via a European Alliance on semiconductors.[39] After reporting earnings in July 2021, the company said they had a near monopoly for machines used by TSMC and Samsung Electronics to make the advanced chips.[40]

In February 2023, ASML claimed that a former worker in China "allegedly" stole information about the company's technology. This wasn't the first time that ASML was allegedly linked with an intellectual property breach connected to China, and this latest breach came in the midst of the US-China trade war, which is also called a "chip war".[41] At the time, the United States Department of Commerce expressed concern about economic espionage against ASML.[42] In October 2023, Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad reported that the former employee who "allegedly" stole data about ASML's technology subsequently went to work for Huawei.[43]

In March 2023, the Dutch government placed restrictions on chip exports in order to protect national security. This measure affected ASML as one of the most important companies in the global microchip supply chain.[44] Export license requirements came into effect in September 2023.[45]

In June 2023, the Netherlands' Institute for Human Rights ruled that despite the country's constitution prohibiting discrimination based on nationality, ASML was allowed to reject job applications from residents of countries subject to sanctions under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria) in order to remain compliant with U.S. law.[46][47][48]

In January 2024, the Dutch government placed further restrictions on the shipment of some advanced chip-making equipment to China.[49]

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC; also called Taiwan Semiconductor)[4][5] is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. It is the world's second most valuable semiconductor company,[6] the world's largest dedicated independent ("pure-play") semiconductor foundry,[7] and its country's largest company,[8][9] with headquarters and main operations located in the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu, Taiwan. It is majority owned by foreign investors,[10] and the central government of Taiwan is the largest shareholder.[11] In 2023, the company was ranked 44th in the Forbes Global 2000.[12]

Taiwan's exports of integrated circuits amounted to $184 billion in 2022, accounted for nearly 25 percent of Taiwan's GDP. TSMC accounts for about 30 percent of the Taiwan Stock Exchange's main index.[13][14]

TSMC was founded in Taiwan in 1987 by Morris Chang as the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry. It has long been the leading company in its field.[15][16] When Chang retired in 2018, after 31 years of TSMC leadership, Mark Liu became chairman and C. C. Wei became Chief Executive.[17][18] It has been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE: 2330) since 1993; in 1997 it became the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: TSM). Since 1994, TSMC has had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4% in revenue and a CAGR of 16.1% in earnings.[19]

Most of the leading fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm and Nvidia, are customers of TSMC, as are emerging companies such as Allwinner Technology, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and UNISOC.[20] Leading programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also make or made use of TSMC's foundry services.[21] Some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities, such as Intel, NXP, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments, outsource some of their production to TSMC.[22][23] At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP portfolio.[dubious – discuss]

TSMC has a global capacity of about thirteen million 300 mm-equivalent wafers per year as of 2020 and makes chips for customers with process nodes from 2 microns to 3 nanometres. TSMC was the first foundry to market 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre (used by the 2020 Apple A14 and M1 SoCs, the MediaTek Dimensity 8100, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors) production capabilities, and the first to commercialize extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in high volume.
History

In 1986, Li Kwoh-ting, representing the Executive Yuan, invited Morris Chang to serve as the president of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and offered him a blank check to build Taiwan's chip industry. At that time, the Taiwanese government wanted to develop its semiconductor industry, but its high investment and high risk nature made it difficult to find investors. Texas Instruments and Intel turned down Chang. Only Philips was willing to sign a joint venture contract with Taiwan to put up $58 million, transfer its production technology, and license intellectual property in exchange for a 27.5 percent stake in TSMC. Alongside generous tax benefits, the Taiwanese government, through the National Development Fund, Executive Yuan, provided another 48 percent of the startup capital for TSMC, and the rest of the capital was raised from several of the island's wealthiest families, who owned firms that specialized in plastics, textiles, and chemicals. These wealthy Taiwanese were directly "asked" by the government to invest. "What generally happened was that one of the ministers in the government would call a businessman in Taiwan," Chang explained, "to get him to invest." From day one, TSMC was not really a private business: it was a project of the Taiwanese state.[24][25][26] Its first CEO was James E. Dykes, who left after a year and Morris Chang became the CEO.[27]

Since then, the company has continued to grow, albeit subject to the cycles of demand. In 2011, the company planned to increase research and development expenditures by almost 39% to NT$50 billion to fend off growing competition.[28] The company also planned to expand capacity by 30% in 2011 to meet strong market demand.[29] In May 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved capital appropriations of US$568 million to increase and improve manufacturing capabilities after the company forecast higher than expected demand.[30] In August 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved additional capital appropriations of US$3.05 billion.[31]

In 2011, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of the A5 SoC and A6 SoCs for Apple's iPad and iPhone devices.[32][33] According to reports,[34] in May 2014 Apple sourced its A8 and A8X SoCs from TSMC.[35][36] Apple then sourced the A9 SoC with both TSMC and Samsung (to increase volume for iPhone 6S launch) and the A9X exclusively with TSMC, thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different microarchitecture sizes. As of 2014, Apple was TSMC's most important customer.[36][37]

In October 2014, ARM and TSMC announced a new multi-year agreement for the development of ARM based 10 nm FinFET processors.[38]

In 2020, TSMC became the first semiconductor company in the world to sign up for the RE100 initiative, pledging to use 100% renewable energy by 2050.[39] TSMC accounts for roughly 5% of the energy consumption in Taiwan, even exceeding that of the capital city Taipei. This initiative was thus expected to accelerate the transformation to renewable energy in the country.[40]

For 2020, TSMC had a net income of US$17.60 billion on a consolidated revenue of US$45.51 billion, an increase of 57.5% and 31.4% respectively from the 2019 level of US$11.18 billion net income and US$34.63 billion consolidated revenue.[41] Its market capitalization was over $550 billion[clarification needed] in April 2021.[citation needed] TSMC's revenue in the first quarter of 2020 reached US$10 billion,[42] while its market capitalization was US$254 billion.[43] TSMC's market capitalization reached a value of NT$1.9 trillion (US$63.4 billion) in December 2010.[44] It was ranked 70th in the FT Global 500 2013 list of the world's most highly valued companies with a capitalization of US$86.7 billion,[45] while reaching US$110 billion in May 2014.[43] In March 2017, TSMC's market capitalization surpassed that of semiconductor giant Intel for the first time, hitting NT$5.14 trillion (US$168.4 billion), with Intel's at US$165.7 billion.[46] On 27 June 2020, TSMC briefly became the world's 10th most valuable company, with a market capitalization of US$410 billion.[47]

As the risk of a war between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China increases, TSMC and its investors have explored options to mitigate the consequences of such an event. Since the beginning of the 2020s, TSMC has expanded its operations outside of the island of Taiwan, opening new fabs in Japan and the United States, with further plans for expansion into Germany.[48] In July 2020, TSMC confirmed it would halt the shipment of silicon wafers to Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei and its subsidiary HiSilicon by 14 September.[49][50]

In November 2020, officials in Phoenix, Arizona in the United States approved TSMC's plan to build a $12 billion chip plant in the city. The decision to locate a plant in the US came after the Trump administration warned about the issues concerning the world's electronics made outside of the U.S.[51] In 2021, news reports claimed that the facility might be tripled to roughly a $35 billion investment with six factories.[52] See TSMC § Arizona for more details.

In June 2021, following nearly a year of public controversy surrounding its COVID-19 vaccine shortage,[53][54][55][56] with only about 10% of its 23.5 million population vaccinated;[53] Taiwan agreed to allow TSMC and Foxconn to jointly negotiate purchasing COVID-19 vaccines on its behalf.[55][53] In July 2021, BioNTech's Chinese sales agent Fosun Pharma announced that the two technology manufacturers had reached an agreement to purchase 10 million BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines from Germany.[55][53] TSMC and Foxconn pledged to each buy five million doses for up to $175 million,[55] for donation to Taiwan's vaccination program.[53]

Due to the 2020–2023 global semiconductor shortage, Taiwanese competitor United Microelectronics raised prices approximately 7–9 percent, and prices for TSMC's more mature processors will be raised by about 20 percent.[57]

In November 2021, TSMC and Sony announced that TSMC would be establishing a new subsidiary named Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing [ja; zh] (JASM) in Kumamoto, Japan. The new subsidiary will manufacture 22- and 28-nanometer processes. The initial investment will be approximately $7 billion, with Sony investing approximately $500 million for a less than 20% stake. Construction of the fabrication plant is expected to start in 2022, with production targeted to begin two years later in 2024.[58][59]

In February 2022, TSMC, Sony Semiconductor Solutions, and Denso announced that Denso would take a more than 10% equity stake in JASM with a US$0.35 billion investment, amid a scarcity of chips for automobiles.[60][61][62] TSMC will also enhance JASM's capabilities with 12/16 nanometer FinFET process technology in addition to the previously announced 22/28 nanometer process and increase monthly production capacity from 45,000 to 55,000 12-inch wafers.[60][61][62] The total capital expenditure for JASM's Kumamoto fab is estimated to be approximately US$8.6 billion.[60][61][62] The Japanese government wants JASM to supply essential chips to Japan's electronic device makers and auto companies as trade friction between the United States and China threatens to disrupt supply chains.[60][61][62] The fab is expected to directly create about 1,700 high-tech professional jobs.[60][61]

In July 2022, TSMC announced the company had posted a record profit in the second quarter, with net income up 76.4 percent year-over-year. The company saw steady growth in the automotive and data center sectors with some weakness in the consumer market. Some of the capital expenditures are projected to be pushed up to 2023.[63]

In the third quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway disclosed purchase of 60 million shares in TSMC, acquiring a $4.1 billion stake, making it one of its largest holdings in a technology company.[64] However, Berkshire sold off 86.2% of its stake by the next quarter citing geopolitical tensions as a factor.[65][66]

In February 2024, TSMC shares hit a record high, with the high on the trading day reaching NT$709 and closing at NT$697 (+8%). This was influenced by the increase in the price target on chip designer Nvidia. TSMC currently manufactures 3-nanometer chips and plans to start 2-nanometer mass production in 2025.[67]
Patent dispute with GlobalFoundries

On 26 August 2019, GlobalFoundries filed several patent infringement lawsuits against TSMC in the US and Germany claiming that TSMC's 7 nm, 10 nm, 12 nm, 16 nm, and 28 nm nodes infringed 16 of their patents.[68] GlobalFoundries named twenty defendants.[69] TSMC said that they were confident that the allegations were baseless.[70]

On 1 October 2019, TSMC filed patent infringement lawsuits against GlobalFoundries in the US, Germany and Singapore, claiming that GlobalFoundries' 12 nm, 14 nm, 22 nm, 28 nm and 40 nm nodes infringed 25 of their patents.[71]

On 29 October 2019, TSMC and GlobalFoundries announced a resolution to the dispute, agreeing to a life-of-patents cross-license for all of their existing semiconductor patents and new patents for the next 10 years.[72][73][74][75][76]

TSMC and the rest of the foundry industry are exposed to the cyclical industrial dynamics of the semiconductor industry. TSMC must ensure its production capacity to meet strong customer demand during upturns. However, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weak demand and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities.[79] As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally also been seasonal, with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.

In 2014, TSMC was at the forefront of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications,[80][81] leading major smartphone chip companies such as Qualcomm,[82][83] Mediatek[83][84] and Apple[35][37] to place an increasing amount of orders.[80] While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation) have encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28 nm capacity,[84] the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.[81]

For most of 2014, TSMC saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted 'unseasonably strong' first-quarter results.[30][85] For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nm technology business growing more than 30% from the previous quarter.[86] Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules,[87] and in August 2014 it was reported that TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.[88]

However, monthly sales for 2014 peaked in October, decreasing by 10% in November due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers.[89] TSMC's revenue for 2014 saw growth of 28% over the previous year, while TSMC forecasted that revenue for 2015 would grow by 15 to 20 percent from 2014, thanks to strong demand for its 20 nm process, new 16 nm FinFET process technology as well as continuing demand for 28 nm, and demand for less advanced chip fabrication in its 200mm fabs.[89]
Technologies

TSMC's N7+ is the first commercially available extreme-ultraviolet lithographic process in the semiconductor industry.[90] It uses ultraviolet patterning and enables more acute circuits to be implemented on the silicon. N7+ offers a 15–20% higher transistor density and 10% reduction in power consumption than previous technology.[91][92] The N7 achieved the fastest ever volume time to market, faster than 10 nm and 16 nm.[93]

The N5 iteration doubles transistor density and improves performance by an additional 15%.[94][95]

It also offers "design for manufacturing" (DFM) customer services.[106]

In press publications, these processes will often be referenced, for example, for the mobile variant, simply by 7nmFinFET or even more briefly by 7FF.

At the beginning of 2019, TSMC was advertising N7+, N7, and N6 as its leading edge technologies,[104]

As of June 2020, TSMC is the manufacturer selected for production of Apple's 5 nanometer ARM processors, as "the company plans to eventually transition the entire Mac lineup to its Arm-based processors, including the priciest desktop computers".[107]

In July 2020, TSMC signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan's west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world's largest corporate green energy order ever made.[108]

In July 2021, both Apple and Intel were reported to be testing their proprietary chip designs with TSMC's 3 nm production.[109]

Fab 21 under construction in Phoenix, Arizona in November 2023

In 2020, TSMC announced a planned fab in Phoenix, Arizona, intended to begin production by 2024 at a rate of 20,000 wafers per month. As of 2020, TSMC announced that it would bring its newest 5 nm process to the Arizona facility, a significant break from its prior practice of limiting US fabs to older technologies. The Arizona plant was estimated to not be fully operational until 2024, when the 5 nm process is projected to be replaced by TSMC's 3 nm process as the latest technology.[110] At launch it will be the most advanced fab in the United States.[111] TSMC plans to spend $12 billion on the project over eight years, beginning in 2021.[110] TSMC claimed the plant will create 1,900 full-time jobs.[112]

In December 2022, TSMC announced its plans to triple its investment in the Arizona plants in response to the growing tensions between the US and China and the supply chain disruption that has led to chip shortages.[113] In that same month, TSMC stated that they were running into major cost issues, because the cost of construction of buildings and facilities in the US is four to five times what an identical plant would cost in Taiwan, (due to higher costs of labor, red tape, and training), as well as difficulty finding qualified personnel (for which it has hired US workers and sent them for training in Taiwan for 12–18 months.) These additional production costs will increase the cost of TSMC's chips made in the US to at least 50% more than the cost of chips made in Taiwan.[114][115][116] In July 2023 TSMC warned that US talent was insufficient, so Taiwanese workers will need to be brought in for a limited time, and that the chip factory won't be operational until 2025.[117] In September 2023, an analyst said the chips will still need to be sent back to Taiwan for packaging.[118] In January 2024, TSMC chairman Liu again warned that Arizona lacked workers with the specialized skills to hire and that TSMC's second Arizona plant likely won't start volume production of advanced chips until 2027 or 2028.[119]

In April 2024, the US Commerce Department agreed to provide $6.6 billion in direct funding and up to $5 billion in loans to TSMC for the purposes of creating semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Arizona. This action falls under the CHIPS and Science Act and is intended to boost domestic chip production for the USA.[120]
Central Taiwan Science Park

The investment of US$9.4 billion to build its third 300mm wafer fabrication facility in Central Taiwan Science Park (Fab 15) was originally announced in 2010.[121] The facility was expected to manufacture over 100,000 wafers a month and generate US$5 billion per year of revenue.[122] TSMC has continued to expand advanced 28 nm manufacturing capacity at Fab 15.[123]

On 12 January 2011, TSMC announced the acquisition of land from Powerchip Semiconductor for NT$2.9 billion (US$96 million) to build two additional 300mm fabs (Fab 12B) to cope with increasing global demand.[124]
WaferTech subsidiary

WaferTech, a subsidiary of TSMC, is a pure-play semiconductor foundry based in Camas, Washington, 32 km (20 mi) outside Portland, Oregon. The WaferTech campus contains a 9.3 ha (23 acres) complex housed on 105 ha (260 acres), with a main fabrication facility consisting of a 12,000 m2 (130,000 sq ft) 200mm wafer fabrication plant.[125] The site is the second-largest pure-play foundry in the United States, employing 1,100 workers.[citation needed] The largest is GlobalFoundries Fab 8 in Malta, New York, which employs over 3,000 workers with over 278,709 m2 (3,000,000 sq ft) under one roof.

As of 2024, the facility supports node sizes of 0.35, 0.30, 0.25, 0.22, 0.18, and 0.16 micrometers, with an emphasis on embedded flash process technology.[126]
History

WaferTech was established in June 1996 as a joint venture with TSMC, Altera, Analog Devices, and ISSI as key partners. The four companies and minor individual investors placed US$1.2 billion into this venture, which was at the time the single largest startup investment in the state of Washington. The company started production in July 1998 in its 200mm semiconductor fabrication plant. Its first product was a 0.35 micrometer part for Altera.[citation needed]

TSMC bought out the joint venture partners in 2000 and acquired full control, operating it as a fully owned subsidiary.[127]

In 2015, Dr. Tsung Kuo was named company president and fab director of WaferTech.[128] 

Space Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly referred to as SpaceX, is an American spacecraft manufacturer, launch service provider, defense contractor and satellite communications company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and ultimately developing a sustainable colony on Mars. The company currently operates the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets along with the Dragon and Starship spacecraft.

The company offers internet service via its Starlink subsidiary, which became the largest-ever satellite constellation in January 2020 and, as of November 2023, comprised more than 5,000 small satellites in orbit.[8]

Meanwhile, the company is developing Starship, a human-rated, fully-reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. On its first flight in April 2023, it became the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. The rocket reached space on its second flight that took place in November 2023.

SpaceX is the first private company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket that has reached orbit; to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station; and to send astronauts to the International Space Station. It is also the first organization of any type to achieve a vertical propulsive landing of an orbital rocket booster and the first to reuse such a booster. The company's Falcon 9 rockets have landed and reflown more than 200 times.[9] As of December 2023, SpaceX has around $180 billion valuation.[10][11]

2001–2004: Founding

In early 2001, Elon Musk met Robert Zubrin and donated US$100,000 to his Mars Society, joining its board of directors for a short time.[12]: 30–31  He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he announced Mars Oasis, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars.[13][14] Musk initially attempted to acquire a Dnepr ICBM for the project through Russian contacts from Jim Cantrell.[15]

When Musk returned to Moscow, Russia, with Michael Griffin, they found the Russians increasingly unreceptive.[16][17] On the flight home Musk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead.[17] By applying vertical integration,[16] using cheap commercial off-the-shelf components when possible,[17] and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch price.[17] Griffin would later be appointed NASA administrator,[18] and play a part in the formation of the COTS program.[19][20]

In early 2002, Elon Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Michael Griffin who was offered the position of Chief Engineer, Jim Cantrel and John Garvey (Cantrel and Garvey would later found the company Vector Launch), rocket engineer Tom Mueller, and Chris Thompson.[21][22] SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such as Tom Mueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from neighboring TRW and Boeing corporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[23] Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's early employees.[24] Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[25]
2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches
Main article: Falcon 1
The first successful Falcon 1 launch in September 2008

SpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with internal funding.[26][27] The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately $90 million[28] to $100 million.[29] The Falcon rocket series was named after Star Wars's Millennium Falcon fictional spacecraft.[30]

In 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) because of a sole-source contract awarded to Kistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could respond, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed the COTS program.[31][32] In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program that would later become the Dragon spacecraft.[33] In 2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded $396 million to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the ISS under the COTS program.[34]

The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under the DARPA Falcon Project which evaluated new US launch vehicles suitable for use in hypersonic missile delivery for Prompt Global Strike.[27][35][36] The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as well,[37] and consequently Tesla, SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same time.[38] Musk was reportedly "waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain" because of the stress.[39]

The financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved on the fourth attempt on 28 September 2008. Musk split his remaining $30 million between SpaceX and Tesla, and NASA awarded the first Commercial Resupply Services contract awarding $1.6 billion to SpaceX in December, thus financially saving the company.[40] Based on these factors and the further business operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following its second successful, and fifth total, launch in July 2009; this allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.[41] Gwynne Shotwell was also promoted to company president at this time, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract.[42]
2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts
Duration: 1 minute and 53 seconds.1:53
Video of the first launch of Falcon 9

SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5.[43] The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006.[44] The overall contract award was $278 million to provide development funding for the Dragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.[44] As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.

The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.[45] By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months.[46]

In April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, NASA issued a $75 million contract for SpaceX to develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.[47] NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-price Space Act Agreement (SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in August 2012.[48]

In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Musk[49] and his seventy million shares were then estimated to be worth $875 million on private markets,[50] valuing SpaceX at $1.3 billion.[51] In May 2012, with the Dragon C2+ launch Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.[52] After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to $2.4 billion or $20/share.[53][54] By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion over its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately $200 million, with Musk investing approximately $100 million and other investors having put in about $100 million.[55]

SpaceX's active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology.[56] The Falcon 9 prototypes performed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL). High-velocity, high-altitude tests of the booster atmospheric return technology began in late 2013.[56]
2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth
Launch of Falcon 9 carrying ORBCOMM OG2-M1, July 2014

SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.[57] That year Arianespace requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX.[58][59] Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA).[60] The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise to over $400 million over the years.[61] In September 2014, NASA's Director of Commercial Spaceflight, Kevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after certification.[48]

In January 2015, SpaceX raised $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately $12 billion.[62] The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite constellation, called Starlink, to provide global broadband internet service with 4,000 satellites.[63]

The Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the seventh ISS resupply mission, CRS-7 exploded two minutes into the flight. The problem was traced to a failed 2-foot-long steel strut that held a helium pressure vessel, which broke free due to the force of acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.[64]
2015–2017: Reusability milestones
Falcon 9 first stage on an autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) barge after the first successful landing at sea, SpaceX CRS-8 mission

SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20.[65] In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean.[66] By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage.[67]

A second major rocket failure happened in early September 2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launch static fire test. The payload, the AMOS-6 communications satellite valued at $200 million, was destroyed.[68] The explosion was caused by the liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels.[69] Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.[70]

Later that year, in March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10 satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.[71] The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket.[72]
2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider

In July 2017, the company raised $350 million, which raised its valuation to $21 billion.[73] In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.[74] By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about $12 billion in contract revenue.[75] The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.[76] This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.[77]

In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company,[78] and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of SpaceX employees,[79] which was completed in May 2018,[80] and opened to the public in December 2018.[81] During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate corporate entity with 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.[81]
2019–present: Starship, first crewed launches, Starlink and general

In 2019 Spacex raised $1.33 billion of capital across three funding rounds.[82] By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to $33.3 billion[83] and reached $36 billion by March 2020.[84]

On 19 August 2020, after a $1.9 billion funding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by any privately held company, SpaceX's valuation increased to $46 billion.[85][86][87]

In February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional $1.61 billion in an equity round from 99 investors[88] at a per share value of approximately $420,[87] raising the company valuation to approximately $74 billion. By 2021, SpaceX had raised more than $6 billion in equity financing. Most of the capital raised since 2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the development and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.[88] By October 2021, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to $100.3 billion.[89] On 16 April 2021, Starship HLS won the contract, and will play a critical role in the Artemis program.[90] By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements with Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to provide on-ground computer and networking services for Starlink.[91] A new round of financing in 2022 values SpaceX at $127 billion.[92]

In July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship named A Shortfall of Gravitas, landing a booster from CRS-23 on it for the first time on 29 August 2021.[93] Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18 rocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. On 13 December 2021, company CEO Elon Musk announced that the company was starting a carbon dioxide removal program that would convert captured carbon into rocket fuel,[94][95] after he announced a $100 million donation to the X Prize Foundation the previous February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the best carbon capture technology.[96][97]

In August 2022, Reuters reported that the European Space Agency (ESA) began initial discussions with SpaceX that could lead to the company's launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked access to Soyuz rockets amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[98] Since that same invasion and in the greater war between Russia and Ukraine, Starlink was extensively used.[99]

In 2022, SpaceX's Falcon 9 also became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle type in a single year.[100][101][non-primary source needed] SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61 launches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket.[100]

In November 2023, SpaceX announced it would acquire its parachute supplier Pioneer Aerospace out of bankruptcy for $2.2 million.[102][103]
Starship

Starship in launch position

In January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects.[104] The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.[105] Spacex's Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, with a payload capacity of 100+ tons.[106][107] Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved to the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year.

On 20 April 2023, Starship's first orbital flight test ended in a mid-air explosion over the Gulf of Mexico before booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the vehicle to reach max q later than planned. "Max q" is the theoretical point of maximal mechanical stress which occurs during the launch sequence of a space vehicle. In the case of a rocket that must be self-destructed during its ascent, max q occurs at the point of self-destruction. Eventually, the vehicle lost control and spun erratically until the automated flight termination system was activated, which intentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space industry have referred to the test flight as a success.[108][109]

Musk said at the time that it would take between "six to eight weeks" to get the infrastructure prepared for another launch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the next test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project's progress, adding the delay could lead to China beating US astronauts back to the Moon.[110][111]

On 18 November 2023, SpaceX launched its second integrated Starship test, with both vehicles flying for a few minutes before separately exploding.[112][113][114][115]

In early March 2024 SpaceX announced that it was targeting 14 March as the tentative launch date for its next unmanned Starship launch configuration flight test, pending the issuance of a "launch license" by the FAA. This license was granted on 13 March 2024.[116] On 14 March 2024 at 13:25 UTC Starship launched for the 3rd time and for the first time Starship reached its planned suborbital trajectory. The flight ended with the booster experiencing a malfunction shortly before landing and the ship being lost during reentry over the Indian Ocean. [106][107]
Crewed launches

A significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years.[117][118] The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.[119]
Starlink

In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become the world's largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.[120] In 2022 most Spacex launches focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming satellites and now has over 2,200 satellites in orbit.[121]

On 16 July 2021 SpaceX entered an agreement to acquire Swarm Technologies, a private company building a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for communications with Internet of things (IoT) devices, for $524 million.[122][4]

In December 2022, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved to launch up to 7,500 of SpaceX's next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network.[123]

Hardware
Launch vehicles
Main article: SpaceX launch vehicles
The landing of a Falcon 9 Block 5 first stage at Cape Canaveral in July 2019. VTVL technologies are used in many of SpaceX's launch vehicles.

SpaceX has developed three launch vehicles. The small-lift Falcon 1 was the first launch vehicle developed and was retired in 2009. The medium-lift Falcon 9 and the heavy-lift Falcon Heavy are both operational.

Falcon 1 was a small rocket capable of placing several hundred kilograms into low Earth orbit. It launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which 2 were successful.[143] The Falcon 1 was the first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.[124]

Falcon 9 is a medium-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265 lb) to orbit, competing with the Delta IV and the Atlas V rockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nine Merlin engines in its first stage. The Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on 4 June 2010. Its third flight, COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on 22 May 2012 and launched the first commercial spacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).[52] The vehicle was upgraded to Falcon 9 v1.1 in 2013, Falcon 9 Full Thrust in 2015, and finally to Falcon 9 Block 5 in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retro propulsively land, be recovered, and reflown.[144]

Falcon Heavy is a heavy-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 63,800 kg (140,700 lb) to Low Earth orbit (LEO) or 26,700 kg (58,900 lb) to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). It uses three slightly modified Falcon 9 first-stage cores with a total of 27 Merlin 1D engines.[145][146] The Falcon Heavy successfully flew its inaugural mission on 6 February 2018, launching Musk's personal Tesla Roadster into heliocentric orbit[147]

Both the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL).[148][149] As of 7 April 2024, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 329 times, resulting in 327 full mission successes, one partial success, and one in-flight failure. In addition, a Falcon 9 experienced a pre-flight failure before a static fire test in 2016.[150][151]

SpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known as Starship. It comprises a reusable first stage, called Super Heavy, and the reusable Starship second stage space vehicle. The system is intended to supersede the company's existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s.[152][153]
Rocket engines
Main article: SpaceX rocket engines
Merlin 1D engine undergoes a test at SpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas

Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed several rocket engines – Merlin, Kestrel, and Raptor – for use in launch vehicles,[154][155] Draco for the reaction control system of the Dragon series of spacecraft,[156] and SuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon.[157]

Merlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants. Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1's first stage and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.[158] Kestrel uses the same propellants and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second-stage main engine.[155][159]

Draco and SuperDraco are hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on the reaction control system of the Dragon and Dragon 2 spacecraft.[156] The SuperDraco engine is more powerful, and eight SuperDraco engines provide launch escape capability for crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft during an abort scenario.[160]

Raptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquid methane-fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle engines to power the first and second stages of the in-development Starship launch system.[154] Development versions were test-fired in late 2016,[161] and the engine flew for the first time in 2019, powering the Starhopper vehicle to an altitude of 20 m (66 ft).[162]
Dragon spacecraft
Main article: SpaceX Dragon
The SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, designed to deliver crew to and from the International Space Station as part of the Commercial Crew Development program

SpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station. The first version of Dragon, used only for cargo, was first launched in 2010.[45] The currently operational second generation Dragon spacecraft, known as Dragon 2, conducted its first flight, without crew, to the ISS in early 2019, followed by a crewed flight of Dragon 2 in 2020.[117] The cargo variant of Dragon 2 flew for the first time in December 2020, for a resupply to the Space Station as part of the CRS contract with NASA.[163]

In March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as a resupply spacecraft for NASA's planned Lunar Gateway space station under a Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) contract.[164] Dragon XL is planned to launch on the Falcon Heavy, and is able to transport over 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) to the Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time.[165]

SpaceX designed a spacesuit to be worn inside the Dragon spacecraft to protect from possible depressurization.
Autonomous spaceport drone ships

SpaceX routinely returns the first stage of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The rocket flights and lands at a predetermined landing site using only its propulsion systems.[166] When propellant margins do not permit a return to launch site (RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform in the ocean, called autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS).[167]

SpaceX also plans to introduce floating launch platforms. These are modified oil rigs to use in the 2020s to provide a sea launch option for their second-generation launch vehicle: the heavy-lift Starship system, consisting of the Super Heavy booster and Starship second stage.
Starlink
Main article: Starlink
Sixty Starlink satellites stacked together before deployment

Starlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX,[7][168] that consists of thousands of cross-linked communications satellites in ~550 km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities.[169]

Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on the SpaceX Paz satellite mission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites aboard a Falcon 9.[170] Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020[171] and first orders were taken in early 2021.[172] Customers were told to expect internet service speeds of 50 Mbit/s to 150 Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms.[173] In December 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million subscribers worldwide.[174]

The planned large number of Starlink satellites has been criticized by astronomers due to concerns over light pollution,[175][176][177] with the brightness of Starlink satellites in both optical and radio wavelengths interfering with scientific observations.[178] In response, SpaceX has implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness.[179] The large number of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers of space debris collisions.[180][181] However, the satellites are equipped with krypton-fueled Hall thrusters which allow them to de-orbit at the end of their life. They are also designed to avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data autonomously.[182]

In December 2022, SpaceX announced Starshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity payloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. The Space Development Agency is a key customer procuring satellites for a space-based missile defense system.[183][184]
Other projects
Main article: Hyperloop pod competition

In June 2015, SpaceX announced that they would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) long subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events.[185][186] The company has held the annual competition since 2017.[187]

In collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of a COVID-19 antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus.[188][189]

In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[190] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, urged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a back-up, in case flooding worsened.[191][192] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[193][194] By this time, however, eight of the 12 children had already been rescued using full face masks and oxygen under anesthesia; consequently Thai authorities declined to use the submarine.[190]

NASA's PACE (plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) satellite launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Stattion's Space Launch Complex 40 at 12.03 PM IST on Thursday, 8 February 2024. The spacecraft was separated from the rocket's second stage a few minutes after that and entered a sun-synchronous orbit. The Falcon 9 rocket also stuck its landing completing the 4th completed flight for this particular Falcon 9 rocket.[195]
Facilities

SpaceX is headquartered in Hawthorne, California, which also serves as its primary manufacturing plant.[196] The company operates a research and major operation in Redmond, Washington, owns a test site in Texas[197] and operates three launch sites, with another under development. SpaceX also operates regional offices in Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.[76] SpaceX was incorporated in the state of Delaware.[198]

SpaceX Headquarters is located in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, California. The large three-story facility, originally built by Northrop Corporation to build Boeing 747 fuselages,[196] houses SpaceX's office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities.[199]

The area has one of the largest concentrations of space sector headquarters, facilities, and/or subsidiaries in the U.S., including Boeing/McDonnell Douglas main satellite building campuses, The Aerospace Corporation, Raytheon, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, United States Space Force's Space Systems Command at Los Angeles Air Force Base, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and AECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace engineers and recent college engineering graduates.[196]

SpaceX uses a high degree of vertical integration in the production of its rockets and rocket engines.[16] SpaceX builds its rocket engines, rocket stages, spacecraft, principal avionics and all software in-house in their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the space industry.[16]

In January 2015, SpaceX announced it would be entering the satellite production business and global satellite internet business. The first satellite facility is a 30,000 sq ft (2,800 m2) office building located in Redmond, Washington. As of January 2017, a second facility in Redmond was acquired with 40,625 sq ft (3,774.2 m2) and has become a research and development laboratory for the satellites.[200] In July 2016, SpaceX acquired an additional 8,000 sq ft (740 m2) office space in Irvine, California to focus on satellite communications.[201]
Development and test facilities

SpaceX operates its Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas. All SpaceX rocket engines are tested on rocket test stands,[197] and low-altitude VTVL flight testing of the Falcon 9 Grasshopper in 2012–2013 were carried out at McGregor.[202] Testing of the much larger Starship prototypes is conducted at the SpaceX Starbase near Brownsville, Texas.[199]

The company purchased the McGregor facilities from Beal Aerospace, where it refitted the largest test stand for Falcon 9 engine testing. SpaceX has made many improvements to the facility since its purchase and has also extended the acreage by purchasing several pieces of adjacent farmland. As of October 2012, the McGregor facility had seven test stands that are operated "18 hours a day, six days a week"[203] and is building more test stands because production is ramping up and the company has a large manifest in the next several years.[204] In addition to routine testing, Dragon capsules (following recovery after an orbital mission), are shipped to McGregor for de-fueling, cleanup, and refurbishment for reuse in future missions.[205]
Launch facilities

Falcon Heavy Side Boosters landing on LZ1 and LZ2 at Cape Canaveral

SpaceX currently operates four orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California for Falcon rockets, and Starbase near Brownsville, Texas for Starship. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad.[206] The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination (28.5–55°).[207] Larger inclinations, including SSO, are possible from Florida by overflying Cuba.[208]

Before it was retired, all Falcon 1 launches took place at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Omelek Island of the Marshall Islands.[209]

In April 2007, the Pentagon approved the use of Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) by SpaceX.[210] The site has been used since 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and geostationary orbits. The former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zones 1 and 2, has since 2015 been used for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.[211]

Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 4 (SLC-4E) was leased from the military in 2011 and is used for payloads to polar orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles,[212] but cannot launch to low inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W was converted to Landing Zone 4 in 2015 for booster landings.[213]

On 14 April 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A.[214] The pad was subsequently modified to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. As of 2024 it is the only pad that supports Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched its first crewed mission to the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on 30 May 2020.[215] Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With delays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in 2022.[216]
The Starship assembly building at SpaceX Starbase in Texas

SpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas, having announced first plans for the launch facility in August 2014.[217][218] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the permit in July 2014.[219] SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015,[220] with the first suborbital launches from the facility in 2019[199] and orbital launches starting in 2023. Some residents of Boca Chica Village, Brownsville, and environmental activists criticized the site along with Starship development program in various aspects.[221][222]
Contracts
Further information on SpaceX launches: Falcon 1 § Launches, List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches, and SpaceX Starship flight tests

SpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts from NASA for the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified for U.S. military launches of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately thirty missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represents over $12 billion under contract.[76]
Cargo to ISS
Main articles: Commercial Orbital Transportation Services, Commercial Resupply Services, and Gateway Logistics Services
The COTS 2 Dragon is berthed to the International Space Station (ISS) by Canadarm2

In 2006, SpaceX won a NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the International Space Station (ISS), with a possible contract option for crew transport.[223] Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide "seed money" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX $396 million to develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with their resources.[224] These Space Act Agreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development 4–10 times cheaper than if produced by NASA alone.[225]

In December 2010 the launch of the SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1 mission, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.[226] Dragon successfully berthed with the ISS during SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2 in May 2012, a first for a private spacecraft.[227]

Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) is a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for the delivery of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016.[228] SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed, and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.[229]

CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the contract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS.[230][228][231] The final Dragon 1 mission, SpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, and Dragon was subsequently retired from service. A second phase of contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will fly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgraded Dragon 2 spacecraft.[232][233] In March 2020, NASA contracted SpaceX to develop the Dragon XL spacecraft to send supplies to the Lunar Gateway space station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy.[234]
Crewed

SpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011,[235][236] followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of its Dragon 2 spacecraft.[237]

In September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing as the two companies that would be funded to develop systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS.[238] SpaceX won $2.6 billion to complete and certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract required SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.[238]

SpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, a Pad Abort Test, in May 2015,[239] and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the ISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.[240] In January 2020, SpaceX conducted an in-flight abort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape engines in a simulated abort scenario.[241]

On 30 May 2020, the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from the U.S. since 2011, and the first commercial crewed launch to the ISS.[242] The Crew-1 mission was successfully launched to the International Space Station on 16 November 2020, with NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker along with JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi,[243] all members of the Expedition 64 crew.[244] On 23 April 2021, Crew-2 was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and K. Megan McArthur, JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet.[245] The Crew-2 mission successfully docked on 24 April 2021.[246]
Resilience after splashdown

SpaceX also offers paid crewed spaceflights for private individuals. The first of these missions, Inspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf of Shift4 Payments CEO Jared Isaacman. The mission launched the Crew Dragon Resilience from the Florida Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A atop a Falcon 9 launch vehicle, placed the Dragon capsule into low Earth orbit, and ended successfully about three days later when the Resilience splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received commercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The training included lessons in orbital mechanics, operating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training, and mission simulations.[247]
National defense
Launch of the STP-2 mission on a Falcon Heavy in June 2019

In 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to $100 million worth of launches from the company.[248] Three years later, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to $1 billion, depending on the number of missions awarded.[249] In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD). The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2). DSCOVR was launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on 25 June 2019.[250]

The Falcon 9 v1.1 was certified for National Security Space Launch (NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.[148] This broke the monopoly held since 2006 by United Launch Alliance (ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of classified payloads.[251] In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch to SpaceX to launch the second GPS III satellite for $82.7 million.[252] This was approximately 40% less than the estimated cost for similar previous missions.[253] SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch on 20 June 2020.[254] In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional $290 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three GPS III satellites.[255]

The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) also purchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking place on 1 May 2017.[256] In February 2019, SpaceX secured a $297 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three national security missions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY 2021.[257] In August 2020, the U.S. Space Force awarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a contract for $316 million for one launch. In addition, SpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military's satellite launch requirements over the period.[258]

SpaceX also designs and launches custom military satellites for the Space Development Agency as part of a new missile defense system in low Earth orbit.[259] The constellation would give the United States capabilities to sense, target and potentially intercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons launched from anywhere on Earth.[260] Both China and Russia brought concerns to the United Nations about the program,[261] and various organizations warn it could be destabilizing and trigger an arms race in space.[262][263]

In March 2024, Reuters reported that, as part of a $1.8-billion contract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office in 2021, SpaceX is building a network of hundreds of spy satellites. This new network, Reuters reported, would be able to operate as a swarm in low orbits.[264]
Launch market competition and pricing pressure
Main article: Space launch market competition

SpaceX's low launch prices, especially for communications satellites flying to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.[16] Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying the Ariane 5) and International Launch Services (flying the Proton).[265] With a published price of $56.5 million per launch to low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the cheapest in the industry.[266] European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of the Ariane 5 and the future Ariane 6 rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX.[267]

SpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to compete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.[268] To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half.[269][270]

Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASA Space Act Agreement process of "setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost. According to NASA's own independently verified numbers, SpaceX's total development cost for the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at $390 million. In 2011, NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about $4 billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.[225] In May 2020, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine remarked that thanks to NASA's investments into SpaceX, the United States has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no commercial launches from the country.[271]

As of 2024, SpaceX operates a Rideshare and Bandwagon (mid inclination) programs. This provides additional competition for small satellite launchers.[272]

Leadership changes

In November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice president Mark Juncosa would oversee Starbase, its Texas launch facility, along with Omead Afshar, who at the time oversaw operations for Tesla in Texas. Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift to its Cape Canaveral site. CNBC reported that these executive moves demonstrated "the sense of urgency within the company to get Starship flying."[285][286][287]
Workplace culture

According to former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated employee culture, similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general.[288] In December 2021, claims of workplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers, were published.[289] The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and uncomfortable interactions.[290] Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture of sexual harassment existing at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human resources officers went largely unaddressed.[291]

In May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX flight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant.[292] In response, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning "Elon's harmful Twitter behavior".[293] It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX's "no-asshole" and "zero tolerance" policies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne Shotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and claimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day and that some felt pressured to sign the letter.[294]

The company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work excessively and is described as fostering a burnout culture.[295] According to a memo by Blue Origin, a rival aerospace company,[296][297][298] SpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays.[295]

AESDECWIDE128KL—Perform Ten Rounds of AES Decryption Flow With Key Locker on 8 Blocks
Using 128-Bit Key
Instruction Operand Encoding
Description
The AESDECWIDE128KL1 instruction performs ten rounds of AES to decrypt each of the eight blocks in XMM0-7
using the 128-bit key indicated by the handle from the second operand. It replaces each input block in XMM0-7
with its corresponding decrypted block if the operation succeeds (e.g., does not run into a handle violation failure).
Operation

IF (Illegal Handle)
THEN RFLAGS.ZF := 1;

AESDECWIDE256KL—Perform 14 Rounds of AES Decryption Flow With Key Locker on 8 Blocks
Using 256-Bit Key
Instruction Operand Encoding
Description
The AESDECWIDE256KL1 instruction performs 14 rounds of AES to decrypt each of the eight blocks in XMM0-7
using the 256-bit key indicated by the handle from the second operand. It replaces each input block in XMM0-7
with its corresponding decrypted block if the operation succeeds (e.g., does not run into a handle violation failure).
Operation

AESENC—Perform One Round of an AES Encryption Flow
Instruction Operand Encoding
Description
This instruction performs a single round of an AES encryption flow using one/two/four (depending on vector
length) 128-bit data (state) from the first source operand with one/two/four (depending on vector length) round
key(s) from the second source operand, and stores the result in the destination operand.
Use the AESENC instruction for all but the last encryption rounds. For the last encryption round, use the AESENC-
CLAST instruction.
VEX and EVEX encoded versions of the instruction allow 3-operand (non-destructive) operation. The legacy
encoded versions of the instruction require that the first source operand and the destination operand are the same
and must be an XMM register.
The EVEX encoded form of this instruction does not support memory fault suppression.

/, placed between sep-

[ ] , containing words that
are not part of the
quotation
Small capitals refer the reader to the article so indicated, for further information.
a, an. i . A is used before all con-
sonants except silent h (a history, an
hour) ; an was formerly usual before an
unaccented syllable beginning with h
and is still often seen and heard (an
historian, an hotel, an hysterical scene,
an hereditary title, an habitual offender).
But now that the h in such words is
pronounced the distinction has become
anomalous and will no doubt disappear
in time. Meantime speakers who like
to say an should not try to have it both
ways by aspirating the h. A is now
usual also before vowel letters that in
pronunciation are preceded by a con-
sonantal sound (a unit, a eulogy, a one).
Before letters standing for abbrevia-
tions or symbols the choice is usually
determined by the sound of the letter,
not of the word it represents, e.g. an
R.A., an M.P.; but that is the sort of
thing about which we ought to be al-
lowed to do as we please, so long as we
are consistent.
2. The combinations of a with few
and many are a matter of arbitrary but
established usage: a few, a great many,
a good many, are idiomatic, but a many
is now illiterate or facetious and a good
few is colloquial; a very few is per-
missible (in the sense some-though-
not-at-all-many, whereas very few
means not-at-all-many-though-some),
but an extremely few is not; see FEW.
3. A, an, follow instead of preceding
the adjectives many, such, and what
(many an artist, such a task, what an
infernal bore !) ; they also follow (i) any
adjective preceded by as or how (I am
as good a man as he; knew how great a
labour he had undertaken), (ii) usually
any adjective preceded by so (so resolute
an attempt deserved success ; a so resolute
attempt is also English, but suggests af-
fectation), and (iii) often any adjective
preceded by too (too exact an, or a too
exact, adherence to instructions). The
late position should not be adopted
with other words than as, how, so, too ;
e.g. in Which was quite sufficient an
indication / Can anyone choose more
glorious an exit? / Have before them far
more brilliant a future,1, the normal
order (a quite or quite a sufficient, a
more glorious, a far more brilliant) is
also the right one.
4 . A, an, are sometimes ungrammati-
cally inserted, especially after no adj.,
to do over again work that has already
been done; so in No more signal a
defeat was ever inflicted (no — not a;
with this ungrammatical use cf. the
merely ill-advised arrangement in Suf-
ferred no less signal a defeat, where no
is an adverb and a should precede it ;
see 3 above). Other examples of the
mistake are: The defendant was no
other a person than Mr. Benjamin
Disraeli (no other = not another). /
Glimmerings of such a royally suggested
even when not royally edited an institu-
tion are to be traced (even . . . edited
being parenthetic, we get such a royally
suggested an institution).
a-, an-, not or without. Punctilious
word-making requires that these should
be prefixed only to Greek stems; of
such compounds there are some hun-
dreds, whereas Latin-stemmed words
having any currency even in scientific
use do not perhaps exceed half a dozen.
There are the botanical acapsular and
acaulous, the biological asexual and
acaudate, and the literary amoral. This
last being literary, there is the less
excuse for its having been preferred
to the more orthodox non-moral.
Amoral is a novelty whose progress
has been rapid. In 1888 the OED
called it a nonce-word, but in 1933 full
recognition had to be conceded.
These words should not be treated as
precedents for future word-making
attempt
prescribe certain rules governing the
sequence in which they should be used
(hence serial). That music so composed
will naturally be atonal is incidental;
Schônberg himself disapproved of the
use of the word as a descriptive label
for his music.
attempt. For zvas attempted to be
done etc. see DOUBLE PASSIVES.
attic. See GARRET.
attraction. A tendency less com-
monly operative in English (except in
mere blunders) than in Latin and
Greek, by which a word is changed
from the correct case, number, or
person, to that of an adjacent word.
When him [whom] we serve 's away;
The wages of sin is death. And (as a
blunder) / have always been surprised
at how little the members of one part
in the House of Commons knows what
happens in the other. See NUMBER 4 .
audience, audition. In their mean-
ing of a formal interview these words
are differentiated: audience has long
been used for one given by a monarch
or other high personage for the trans-
action of business; audition was
adopted at the beginning of the 20th c.
for one given by an impresario to an
aspiring performer. Audition is now
being used as a verb. There seems no
more reason to take exception to this
than to the use as verbs of commission
and petition, unless it be that one is
new and the others established by
centuries of usage.
au fond. See À FOND.
aught. See WARDOUR STREET. For a. I
know is the only phrase in which the
word is still current in ordinary speech,
and even there all is displacing it.
autarchy, autarky. Autarchy, abso-
lute sovereignty, autarky (sometimes
misspelt -chy) self-sufficiency, are from
different Greek words: this accounts
for the difference in spelling, which
should be preserved.
authentic, genuine. The distinction
commonly drawn between the words
42 authoritarian
is by no means universally observed,
especially when either is used without
special reference to the other; but,
when a distinction is present to the
mind, authentic implies that the con-
tents of a book, picture, account, or the
like, correspond to facts and are not
fictitious, and genuine implies that its
reputed author is its real one : a genuine
Hobbema; An authentic description;
The Holbein Henry VIII is both authen-
tic and genuine (represents Henry as he
was, or is really a portrait of him, and
is by Holbein). The artificial character
of the distinction, however, is illus-
trated by the fact that, genuine having
no verb of its own, authenticate serves
for both.
authoress is a word that has always
been disliked by authoresses them-
selves, perhaps on the ground that sex
is irrelevant to art and that the word
implies disparagement of women's
literary abilities. They had good
reason to be sensitive: as recently as
1885 a Savoy audience was invited to
applaud the sentiment that 'that
singular anomaly the lady novelist'
never would be missed. When the
OED was published the authoresses
seemed to be getting their way; for the
opinion is there given that authoress 'is
now only used when sex is purposely
emphasized; otherwise in all the
senses, and especially the last [se. a
female literary composer], author is
now used of both sexes'. But authoress
is dying hard. Seventy years after the
OED's pronouncement a book re-
viewer still finds it natural to say The
authoress does not much discuss the
quality of acting in Garrick's theatre,
and a High Court judge to say The
wife was in several respects the autJwress
of her own wrong because of her nagging.
See also FEMININE DESIGNATIONS.
authoritarian, authoritative. The
differentiation is complete: -arian
means favourable to the principle of
authority as opposed to that of indivi-
dual freedom; -ative means possessing
due or acknowledged authority; en-
titled to obedience or acceptance
(OED).
autocar
autocar, autocycle, automobile.
In spite of our general disposition to
borrow words from America, we have
firmly rejected the U.S. automobile in
favour of our motor car, motor, or now
more generally car, though we pre-
serve automobile in the title of the
Association and Club, and Autocar in
that of the periodical. Autocycle re-
mains in the A. Union, but the vehicles
it is interested in are in common par-
lance either motor bicycles or mopeds.
automation. Mechanization, enabling
machines to do work formerly done by
human muscles, produced the indus-
trial revolution. Automation, enabling
machines to do work formerly done by
the human brain, is said to be pro-
ducing another, not less epoch-mak-
ing. It is a pity that the word for
something so important (with its back-
formation verb automate now in-
evitably appearing) should be a
*BAKBARISM\ But automatism was not
available, having been given a different
job; and it cannot be denied that the
words chosen have practical ad-
vantages over the more orthodox but
more cumbrous automatize and auto-
matization that might have been
formed from the Greek verb aÙTo/icm'£to.

avail, yb. The constructions be availed
of, avail of, illustrated in the following
quotations are wrong: If economical
means of transport are availed o/(made
use of). / No salvage appliances could
have been availed of in time (used). /
A desire to avail of the quieter phase of
national emotion (take advantage of).
The normal construction is avail one-
self of (/ shall a. myself of your kind
offer). From this are wrongly evolved
('with indirect passive, especially in
U.S.' says the OED, but with exam-
ples from English newspapers too)
such forms as The offer was availed of;
the absurdity of this is patent as soon
as the method is applied to similar
reflexive verbs; because we can say
They busy themselves in politics, You
should rid yourself of cant, Many devote
themselves to religion, we do not infer
43 a v e n g e
that Politics are busied in, Cant should
be ridded of, Religion is often devoted to,
are English; as little does avail oneself
of the offer justify the offer was availed
of. Available, which perhaps encour-
ages the use of these bad constructions,
lends them no real support ; its original
sense was that can avail, and what it
would suggest is rather avail the offer
than avail of the offer.
avant-garde. Eugene Ionesco, one of
the avant-garde of French playwrights. /
Though he read the accepted authors, he
was also attracted by the avant-garde of
writing in his time. / In television . . . a
conscientious critic in the prime of life
can see everything, avant garde and
rearguard, and all that lies between. / It
might seem odd to many a j8-year-old
composer to be represented in a Festival
of this kind at all, so avant-garde is the
International Society of Contemporary
Music in its trends. In 1888 the OED
said that avant-garde had been re-
placed by the aphetic form vanguard,
and had become archaic or obsolete.
The 1933 Supp. did not disturb this
verdict. But the critics have since
decided that vanguard will no longer
do; avant-garde has become for them
the inevitable word, to serve the same
purpose in the middle of the 20th
century as fin de siècle did at the end of
the 19th. It seems, however, that they
are now beginning to feel the need of a
word for what is even more avant
garde than avant garde itself, and
vanguard is coming back into its own.
Extreme vanguard music is the descrip-
tion applied by a music critic to a
concert displaying 'mere belligerence
towards the condition of music' given
by a group of young composers under
dadaist influence.
avenge, revenge, vengeance.
Avenge and vengeance are one pair,
revenge verb and noun another. The
distinction between the two pairs is
neither very clear nor consistently ob-
served. This is natural, since the same
act done under the same conditions
may be described either as vengeance
or as revenge according to the point of
view from which it is regarded. It may
averse
be said, roughly, that vengeance is
redressing the balance by an offender's
being made to suffer something more
or less equivalent to his offence, while
revenge is the satisfying of the offended
party's resentment by the same means ;
one act may effect both, but it will be
spoken of by one name or the other
according to context. It is in harmony
with this that the subject of the active
verb revenge is ordinarily the wronged
party, and its object either himself or a
wrong done at least indirectly to him,
while the subject of avenge is ordinarily
a disinterested party, and its object
another person or a wrong done to
another. Exceptions are numerous,
but choice may be assisted by
remembering the general principle
that personal feeling is the thing
thought of when revenge is used, and
the equalization of wrongs when
avenge or vengeance is used.
averse, aversion. To insist on from
as the only right preposition after
these, in spite of the more general use
of to {What cat's averse to fish?—Gray.
He had been averse to extreme courses.—
Macaulay. Nature has put into man an
aversion to misery.—Locke) is one of
the pedantries that spring of a little
knowledge. If averse meant originally
turned away, and a is Latin for away,
this did not prevent even the writers
of classical Latin from using the dative
after aver sus; nor, if it had, need it
prevent us, to whom the original and
physical sense is not usually present,
from using after averse and aversion
the preposition that best fits their true
sense.
avocation, originally a calling away,
an interruption, a distraction, is used
in Britain, though not in U.S., as
a stylish synonym for vocation or
calling, with which it is properly in
antithesis. This has destroyed a useful
differentiation; but vocation has re-
tained the idea of a 'calling'; a man is
fortunate if his avocation, in the sense
of his occupation, is also his vocation.
avoidance of the obvious is very
well, provided that it is not itself ob-
vious; but, if it is, all is spoilt. Expel
44 avoidance
eager or greedy or keen from your
sentence in favour of avid, and your
reader wants to know why you have
done it. If he can find no better
answer than that you are attitudiniz-
ing as an epicure of words for whom
nothing but the rare is good enough,
or, worse still, that you are pain-
fully endeavouring to impart some
much needed unfamiliarity to a plati-
tude, his feeling towards you will
be something that is not admiration.
The obvious is better than obvious
avoidance of it. Nobody could have
written 'Clown' who had not been (as
Air. Disher is known to be) an avid
collector of pantomime traditions and
relics. / Everything is just in a state of
suspended animation, and the House,
instead of being in its usual bustle on
account day, is devoid. / Lord Lans-
downe has done the Liberal Party a good
turn by putting Tariff Reform to the
front; about this there can be no dubiety./
If John never 'finishes' anything else, he
can at least claim by sheer labour to have
completed over five-score etchings. There
are some who would rather see eager
and empty and doubt and a hundred in
those sentences than avid, devoid,
dubiety, and five-score; and there are
some who would not ; the examples are
typical enough to sort tastes.
Several words can be thought of that
have been through this course. Start-
ing as variants for the business word,
some with their own special and useful
functions, they have been so seized
upon by those who scorn to talk like
other people as to become a badge by
which we may know them ; after which
they pass into general use by the side
of the words to which they were pre-
ferred, giving the language pairs of
useless synonyms that have lost what-
ever distinction there may once have
been between them. Such words are
cryptic, dual,facile,forceful, and Gallic,
as used without the justification of
special meanings instead of obscure,
double, easy, for cible, and French; on all
of these comment will be found in
their separate articles. A few examples
of the uses deprecated are : 'A sensible
young man, of rough but mild manners.
avouch
and very seditious'; this description,
excepting the first clause, is somewhat
cryptic. / The combination of cricket and
rowing 'blues' is very rare; the late
J. W. Dale was the last Cambridge man
to earn the dual distinction. The 'dual
event' is perhaps already, and will
surely soon be, upon us. / The re-
union of a Labour and Socialist World
Conference has not proved to be so facile
to arrange as it appeared, j ' / blame the
working of the Trade Board' said Mr.
Newey, forcefully, '/or keeping wages at
an artificial figure.'
avouch, avow, vouch. The living
senses of the three words are distinct ;
but, as a good deal of confusion has
formerly prevailed between them, the
dictionaries are not very helpful to
inquirers, providing as they do quota-
tions under each for senses that
now belong only to one of the
others; it is therefore worth while
to state roughly the modern usage.
Avouch, which is no longer in com-
mon use, means guarantee, solemnly
aver, prove by assertion, maintain
the truth or existence of, vouch
for (A miracle avouched by the
testimony of . . .; Millions zvere ready to
avouch the exact contrary ; Offered to
avouch his innocence with his szvord).
Avow means own publicly to, make no
secret of, not shrink from admitting,
acknowledge one's responsibility for
{Think what one is asliamed to avow;
Avowed himself my enemy; Avowed his
determination to be revenged; Always
avows, and cf. in the contrary sense
disavows, his agents). Vouch is now
common only in the phrase vouch for,
which has taken the place of avouch in
ordinary use, and means pledge one's
word for (Will you vouch for the truth
of it?; I can vouch for his respectability).
await, wait. Await is always transi-
tive, but wait is not always intransitive.
/ am awaiting to hear your decision is
not English ; / await, and / wait, your
decision are equally good though the
latter is less usual. See WAIT.
awake, awaken, wake, waken.
Awake has past awoke, rarely awaked,
45 away
and p.p. awaked sometimes awoken
and rarely awoke; wake has past woke,
rarely (and that usually in transitive
sense) waked, and p.p. waked, rarely
woke or woken; awaken and waken
have -ed.
Distinction between the forms is diffi-
cult, but with regard to modern usage
certain points may be made : (i) Wake
is the ordinary working verb ( You will
wake the baby ; Something woke me up ;
I should like to be waked at 7.30 ; Wake
the echoes), for which the others are
substituted to add dignity or formality,
or to suit metre, or as in (3) or (5)
below. (2) Wake alone has (and
that chiefly in waking) the sense be
or remain awake (Sleeping or waking;
In our waking hours.) (3) Awake
and awaken are usually preferred to the
others in figurative senses (When they
awoke, or were awakened, to their
danger; This at once awakened suspi-
cion ; The national spirit awoke, or zvas
awakened; A rude awakening). (4)
Waken and awaken tend to be re-
stricted to the transitive sense; when
he wakens is rarer for when he wakes
than that zvill waken him for that will
wake him. (5) In the passive, azvaken
and waken are often preferred to awake
and wake, perhaps owing to uncer-
tainty about the p.p. forms of the latter
pair; it wakened me is rare for it woke
or waked me, but / was wakened by it
is common for / was zvaked or woke or
woken by it; see also the alternative
forms in (3) above. (6) Up is very com-
monly appended to wake, rarely to
waken, and never to awake and awaken.
away. 1. For once and azvay see ONCE.
2. For cannot away zvith see ARCHAISM.
3. Way as an abbreviation of away in
such compound adverbs as w. above,
to. back, w. below, zv. up is a common
Americanism that has not yet taken
root here ; it is surprising, and perhaps
significant of a change in our attitude
towards it, to find such sentences as
these in The Times and The T.L.S.:
Education begins way back in the home.
At a time when tension between India
and Pakistan, for reasons way above the
understanding of those killed or killing)
awfully
is rising to danger point. / That betraying
adjective 'strange' places him . . . way
back on the rickety rationalist Olympus
of Edward Gibbon.
awfully. See TERRIBLY.
axiom. See APHORISM.
ay, aye. The word meaning yes is
pronounced ï, and the poetic word
meaning ever is pronounced â; but
which spelling corresponds to which
pronunciation has been disputed. The
nautical Ay, ay, sir is usually written
thus ; and aye is the usual spelling now
for ever; on the other hand the ayes
have it is so written, though -es may
there be intended for the plural termi-
nation. Ay (i) yes, aye (â) ever, seem
now established (as is recognized by
the COD) though the authority of the
OED was on the other side.
azure. Under the influence of the
speak-as-you-spell movement (see
PRONUNCIATION i ) the conventional
pronunciation â'zhër is giving place to
one that gives full value to the u,
recognized at least as an alternative by
most modern dictionaries.
B
babe, baby. In the primary sense
baby is now the regular form, and babe
archaic, poetic, or rhetorical. In figu-
rative use, babe implies guilelessness,
innocence, or ignorance, and baby
unmanliness. The slang use of baby
for a girl friend is an Americanism that
has made little headway with us, but
we owe to that country the indispen-
sable baby-sitter.
bacchanal, bacchant(e). The nouns
bacchanal and bacchant are used of
both males and females, but with
a tendency to be restricted to males;
bacchante is used of females only.
Bacchant is always pronounced ba'-
kânt; bacchante is bâkâ'nt, bâ'kânt, or
bâkâ'nti. Bacchant has plural bacchants
or bacchantes; bacchante has bacchantes
(-ts or -tïz).
bacillus. PI. bacilli; see -us, and

MICRO-ORGANISMS.
back formation. A dictionary defini-
tion of the term is : The making from
a supposed derivative (as lazy, banting)
of the non-existent word (laze, bant)
from which it might have come. It is
natural to guess that the words scaven-
ger, salvage, and gridiron are formed
from verbs scavenge and salve and a
noun grid, and consequently to use
those verbs and noun if occasion
arises. Those who first used them,
however, were mistaken, and were
themselves making the words out of
what they wrongly took for their
derivatives; similarly banting is not
formed from bant, but is the name first
of a man, and then of his system, out
of which the verb to bant was made by
back formation. This will perhaps
sufficiently explain the references
made here and there to this article.
Some back formations are not gener-
ally recognized as such, and have the
full status of ordinary words, e.g.
diagnose (from diagnosis), drowse (from
drowsy), sidle (from sideling = side-
long), grovel (from grovelling, an ad-
verb), resurrect (from resurrection), and
BURGLE (from burglar). But when first
invented they are generally felt to be
irregular and used only ignorantly,
slangily, or jocosely; so buttle, chinée,
ENTHUSE, frivol, liaise, locomote, maffick,
ORATE, PROCESS (go in procession),
revolute. Other articles that may be
looked at are BRINDLE, FILTRATE, GRID-
IRON, GUERILLA, and SALVE.
back of as a preposition meaning
behind is an American, not a British,
idiom, unless it is to be regarded as a
preposition in the phrase b. of beyond.
background. Tell me your background
has become the fashionable way of
saying tell me all about yourself . Within
reason this is a proper and useful
extension of a meaning defined by the
OED as that which lies at the back of
or beyond the chief object of contem-
plation. Egypt is the b. of the whole
history of the Israelites. / The successful
candidates included boys and girls of
backlog
very different bb. But it has become too
popular as a VOGUE WORD, saving its
user the trouble of thinking of a more
precise word such as origin, cause,
reason) explanation, qualifications, and
others. The activities of a few shop
stewards provide the b. of the trouble
(are the cause). / Your b. seems more
suitable for employment in an engineer-
ing establishment (qualifications).
backlog. To the OED this is only
known as a large log placed at the back
of a fire (chiefly U.S.). That this would
remain comparatively unburnt while
the rest of the fire was consumed was
presumably the reason for the now
very popular metaphorical use of the
word(esp. U.S.) in the sense of arrears.
What the Telephone Department of
the G.P.O. calls List of waiting appli-
cants the American Telephone and
Telegraph Company calls Backlog of

backward(s). As an adverb either
form may be usedj as an adjective
backward only.
bade. See BID.
baggage. Englishmen travel by land
with luggage and by sea and air with
baggage. Americans, more sensibly,
travel everywhere with baggage.
bail out, bale out. In the sense of
securing someone's release from cus-
tody by guaranteeing his reappearance,
the spelling is always bail. The OED
says that the same spelling should be
used for emptying a boat of water;
bale is 'erroneous' because the deriva-
tion is from French bailie, bucket.
But, perhaps owing to an instinct for
DIFFERENTIATION, popular usage pre-
fers bale both for this and for making
a parachute descent from an aircraft in
an emergency.
balance, in the sense rest or remain-
der, is, except where the difference
between two amounts that have to be
compared is present to the mind, a
SLIPSHOD EXTENSION. We may fairly
say 'you may keep the balance', be-
cause the amount due and the amount
that more than covers it suggest com-
47 b a l u s t e r s
parison; but in 'the b. of the day is
given to amusement' such a compari-
son between amounts is, though not
impossible, farfetched, and the plain
word (rest, or remainder) is called for.
For IMBALANCE see that article.
ballad(e). A ballad was originally a
song as accompaniment to dancing;
later any simple sentimental song
especially of two or more verses each
to the same melody, e.g. Jonson's
Drink to me only. A separate modern
use is as the name of simple narrative
poems in short stanzas, such as Chevy
Chase.
A ballade is an elaborate poem con-
sisting of three eight (or ten) line
stanzas and a four (or five) line envoy,
all on three (or four) rhymes only in
the same order in each stanza, and with
the same line ending each stanza and
the envoy. An old French form, re-
vived in France and England in the
19th c.
ballyrag, bullyrag. The etymology
is unknown; the second form is prob-
ably due to a supposed connexion,
described by the OED as 'unlikely',
with bully, the first form is far more
common, and seems preferable.
balmy, b a r m y . Barmy, not balmy, as
it is sometimes misspelt, is the slang
word for crazy. It is the adjective of
barm, the froth that forms on the top
of fermenting malt liquor; the OED
gives I7th-c. examples of its use with
brain and head in the sense of frothy,
excited. Balmy is the adjective of balm,
fragrant salve, the stuff about which
Jeremiah asked whether there was
none in Gilead. See HACKNEYED
PHRASES.
balusters, banisters. Originally the
latter was a corruption of the former :
both meant uprights supporting a rail.
They have become differentiated in
two respects: banisters are commonly
wood and indoors and balusters stone
and outside; and banisters is used of
the complete structure of uprights and
what they support and balusters is not;
balustrade is the word for that.
banal 48
banal, banality. These were im-
ported from France by a class of
writers whose jaded taste relished
novel or imposing jargon. In French
they have had a continuous history and
a natural development from their
original to their present sense; in
English they have not, and though
they have been with us for very many
years are not yet wholly natural-
ized. With common, commonplace, trite,
trivial, mean, vulgar, truism, platitude,
and other English words, to choose
from, we should confine banal and
banality, since we cannot get rid of
them, to occasions when we want to
express a contempt deeper than any of
the English words can convey. We
have not even agreed about the pro-
nunciation. Bd'nâl, bâ'nâl, banal', and
bânahl all have some dictionary
recognition. The fully anglicized
bâ'nal is recommended.
banisters. See BALUSTERS.
baptist(e)ry. The -tery form is the
better.
bar. B. sinister, popularly supposed
to be a symbol of illegitimacy, is
strictly incorrect, bend or baton sinister
being the true term. It is, however, so
familiar that to correct it, except where
there is real need for technical accu-
racy, is pedantic; see DIDACTICISM.
barbarian, barbaric, barbarous.
The differences in usage among the
three adjectives are roughly, and set-
ting aside special senses of the first, as
follows. Barbarian, as an adjective, is
now regarded as an attributive use of
the noun barbarian; i.e. it is used only
in such ways as would be admis-
sible for nouns like soldier or German
(a soldier king or people; German ances-
try or thoroughness), and means con-
sisting of barbarians, being a barbarian,
belonging to or usual with barbarians.
So we have barbarian tribes, hosts,
frankness, courage; a barbarian king,
home, empire; barbarian man (the
human race as barbarians); the bar-
barian world.
The other two words are ordinary
adjectives, but differ in their implica-
barbarisms
tions. Barbaric is used with indul-
gence, indifference, or even admira-
tion, and means of the simple,
unsophisticated, uncultured, un-
chastened, tasteless, or excessive kind
that prevails among barbarians. We
speak of barbaric taste, finery, splen-
dour, costume, gold, hospitality, simpli-
city, strength, health.
Barbarous, on the other hand, always
implies at least contempt, and often
moral condemnation; it means that is
unfit for or unworthy of or revolts or
disgraces or would disgrace the civil-
ized: barbarous ignorance, speech, cus-
toms, style, words, cruelty, treatment,
tyranny.
barbarism, barbarity, barbarous-
ness. The three nouns all belong to
the adjective barbarous, but the first
two are now (putting aside intentional
arch

tions, etc. A selection of these is : as to

500,000 houses are required, and the
aggregate cost is in the region of
£400,000,000. / Sir Robert Peel used
to tell an amusing story of one of these
banquets, in the case of which he and
Canning were seated on opposite sides
of Alderman Flower. I If I have a com-
plaint to proffer against Mr. Bedford,
it certainly is, except perhaps in the case
of 'Monna Vanna', not in the matter
of the plays to which he has refused a
licence, but in regard to a few of the
plays which he sanctioned, j We have
arranged a competition in regard to
imitating Pepys's style.
But so much has been said on the
subject, and so many illustrations given,
elsewhere (see PERIPHRASIS, and the
words in small capitals in the list above)
that nothing but a very short general
statement need be made here. Of such
phrases some are much worse in their
effects upon English style than others,
in order that being perhaps at one end
of the scale, and in the case of or as to
at the other; but, taken as a whole,
they are almost the worst element in
modern English, stuffing up what is
written with a compost of nouny ab-
stractions. To young writers the dis-
covery of these forms of speech, which
are used very little in talk and very
much in print, brings an expansive
sense of increased power; they think
they have acquired with far less trouble
than they expected the trick of dressing
up what they may have to say in the
right costume for public exhibition.
Later they know better, and realize
that it is feebleness instead of power
102 concern
that they have been developing; but
by that time the fatal ease that the
compound-preposition style gives (to
the writer, that is) has become too dear
to be sacrificed.
comprehend. See APPREHEND.
comprise. Many of the airs used by
Handel in his operas have been arranged
by Sir Thomas Beecham to c. a ballet
suite, j The Government of the Federa-
tion and the three territories which c.

nuclear deterrent. This lamentably
common use of comprise as a synonym
of compose or constitute is a wanton and
indefensible weakening of our vocabu-
lary. For the distinction between com-
prise and include see INCLUDE.
comptroller, cont-. The first spelling
is not merely archaic, but erroneous,
being due to false association with
count(F conter f. L computare). Govern-
ment officials bearing that title are now
ordinarily controllers, but statute or
antiquity has established comptroller
for some of them, e.g. C. and Auditor-
General, Deputy Master and C. of the
Mint, C. of the Royal Household, and
C.-General of the Patent Office.
comrade. For the pronunciation (ko-
or kû-) see PRONUNCIATION 5.
concept is a philosophical term. The
philosophers have not been allowed to
keep it to themselves, and its extended
use is sometimes legitimate; but the
substitution of it for the ordinary word
conception in such a context as the fol-
lowing is due to NOVELTY-HUNTING:
[a caricature has been described] Now
this point of view constantly expressed
must have had its influence on popular
concepts. See POPULARIZED TECHNI-
CALITIES. The fate of such words is
often to be put to menial work, and
concept is no exception, as in the
advertisement A new c. in make-up,
blessing your skin with its incredible
beauty benefits.
concern. 1. In (so far) as concerns or
regards, the number of the verb (which
concernment 103
is impersonal, or has for its unexpressed
subject 'our inquiry' or some such
phrase) is invariable; the change to
plural, as in the quotation that follows,
is due, like as FOLLOW, to misappre-
hension: Many of these stalks were
failures, so far as concern the objective
success,
2. The idiomatic use of so far as . ..
concerned, e.g. so far as I am concerned,
meaning so far as I have any say in the
matter, or for all I care ( That's all right
s.f. a. la. c; You may go to the devil
s.f. a. I a. c.) is often improperly, and
even absurdly, extended to serve as
one of the least excusable types of
COMPOUND PREPOSITIONS. The punish-
ment does not seem to have any effect so
far as the prisoners are concernedipn the
prisoners). / The months of January,
February, and part of March 1963
were disastrous as far as the building
industry of this country was concerned
(for the building industry). / The girl
is entirely unknown as far as the larger
cinema audiences are concerned (to the
larger audiences).
3. For the unidiomatic omission of
the verb in such phrases as so far as
concerns see FAR 4.
concernment has no senses that are
not as well, and now more naturally
and frequently, expressed by the noun
concern; the substitution of the latter
was censured as affectation in the 17th
c, but the boot is now on the other leg,
and c. should be dropped as a NEEDLESS
VARIANT.
concession is a word widely used in
British domestic politics for the prac-
tical recognition by Authority that a
citizen, or a body of citizens, with a
grievance has an unanswerable case,
e.g. for the restoration of rights or
possessions expropriated during an
'emergency' or, like the 'extra-statutory
cc' granted by the Board of Inland
Revenue, for waiving a liability that
causes indefensible hardship in par-
ticular circumstances. It is an un-
fortunate word for this purpose; a
flavour of royal condescension is still
latent in it, suggesting that what to one
party may seem an act of bare justice
condition
is regarded by the other as one of grace
and favour, and so widening the gulf
that is supposed to exist between 'Us'
and 'Them'. But the word is too con-
venient to permit of any hope of its
disuse.
conciseness, concision. The first is
the English word familiar to the ordi-
nary man; concision is the LITERARY
CRITICS' WORD, more recent in Eng-
lish, used by writers under French
influence, and often requiring the
reader to stop and think whether he
knows its meaning: The writing of verse
exacts concision, clear outline, a dam-
ming of the waters at the well-spring.
See -ION AND -NESS.
concomitance, -cy. The second is
now a NEEDLESS VARIANT; see -CE, -CY.
concur. For the pronunciation of in-
flected forms see PRONUNCIATION 7.
condign meant originally deserved,
and could be used in many contexts,
with praise for instance as well as with
punishment. It is now used only with
words equivalent to punishment, and
means deservedly severe, the severity
being the important point, and the
desert merely a condition of the appro-
priateness of the word; that it is an
indispensable condition, however, is
shown by the absurd effect of: Count
Zeppelin's marvellous voyage through
the air has ended in c. disaster.
condition. The use of c. as a transitive
verb is condemned by some purists as
'not English', but in fact the word has
been so used for more than 400 years,
and for more than 300 in the sense
most common today—to govern as a
condition. The OED quotes M. Arnold
Limits we did not set condition all we do.
Its use in the sense of to put into good
condition, or make responsive to sug-
gestion, especially of horses and dogs,
prisoners of war and deviationists,
is comparatively modern, and is
being widened both by the invention
of air-conditioning and by advertisers'
adopting it as a word of appeal, These
cigarettes are CONDITIONED! The
similar use of recondition is also
conditional clauses
recent (the earliest example in OED
Supp. is dated 1920) but is now estab-
lished, especially of buildings, ships,
and motor cars and other machinery.
conditional clauses. See SUBJUNC-
TIVE.
conduce. A sore throat did not c. him
to make a major effort. This should be
either induce him to make or c. to his
making; conduce as a transitive verb
is obsolete.
conductress. See FEMININE DESIGNA-
TIONS.
conduit. Pronounce kù'ndït. See
PRONUNCIATION 5 .
confection. The French dressmaking
term properly means no more than a
piece of attire not made to measure;
but, being applied chiefly to fashion-
able wraps etc., it is sometimes mis-
understood as expressing in itself (like
creation) the speaker's exclamatory ad-
miration.
confederacy, -eration. See FEDERA-
TION.
confer(r)able. Of the verbs in -fer
accented on the last syllable, two form
adjectives in -ble of which the spelling
and accent are fixed (preferable and
transferable). The others, for which
various forms have been tried {confer)
confe'rrable; defer, none; infer, infer-
able and infe'rible and infe'rrable and
infe'rrible; refer, referable and refe'rrable
and refe'rrible), should be made to fol-
low these two; inferable and referable
are doing so, but the dictionaries would
still have us say conferr'able.
confidant, -ante, -ent. Co'nfident
was in use as a noun meaning con-
fidential friend or person to whom one
entrusted secrets long before the other
forms were introduced; but it is now
an ARCHAISM, and to revive it is pedan-
try. Confidant is masculine and con-
fidante feminine; they are indistin-
guishable in pronunciation, and ac-
cent the last syllable.
conform(able). He is as anxious as
anyone to conform with the laws and
104 conjunctive
spirit of the game. Idiom demands
conform to, not with. For such forma-
tions as conformable see -ABLE 4.
congeries. The pronunciation fa-
voured by the dictionaries is -jë'rtës,
but see -IES, -EIN.
conjunction. A word whose function
is to join like things together, i.e. a
noun or its equivalent with another
noun or its equivalent, an adjective
etc. with another, adverb etc. with
adverb etc., verb with verb, or sen-
tence with sentence. The relation be-
tween the things joined is shown by
the particular conjunction chosen (but,
and, or nor; if, although, or because;
that or lest; since or until). Some con-
junctions, in joining two sentences,
convert one into a dependency of the
other, or of a clause in it, and are called
subordinating or strong cc, the others
being co-ordinating or weak (strong—
I hate him because he is a Judas : weak
—I hate him; for he is a Judas). Many
words are sometimes conjunctions and
sometimes adverbs (therefore, so, how-
ever, since, etc.); and such words as
when and where, though often in effect
cc, are more sti ictly described as rela-
tive adverbs with expressed or implied
antecedent (/ remember the time when,
i.e. at which, it happened; I will do it
when, i.e. at the time at which, / see fit).
conjunctive (mood) is a term that
had much better be dropped. The
forms denoted by c. and subjunctive
are the same, and subjunctive is the
much better known name. C. might
have been useful in distinguishing uses
if it had been consistently applied ; but
it means sometimes the forms however
used (subjunctive then being a division
under it restricted to the subordinate
uses), sometimes the forms when used
as main verbs (subjunctive then being
a division parallel to it restricted as
before), and sometimes merely the
forms when used as main verbs of con-
ditional sentences (subjunctive then
being, very unreasonably, the name
for all uses, dependent or independent,
and c. a division under it). This is
hopeless confusion; c. should be given
conjure 105
up, subjunctive be used as the name of
the forms whatever their use, and the
differences of function be conveyed by
other words (dependent) conditional,
optative, etc.).
conjure in the sense beseech is pro-
nounced konjoor's in other senses
kû'njer.
conjuror, -er. Although in the OED
I9th-c. quotations -or is five times as
common as -er for the juggler, the
latter is put first by the S OED and
other more recent dictionaries; the
partner in an oath is always -or with
the stress on the second syllable.
connexion, -ction. 1 . The first is
the etymological spelling; see -XION.
But the second is now more common,
and standard U.S.
2. In c. with is a formula that every
one who prefers vigorous to flabby
English will have as little to do with
as he can; see COMPOUND PREPOSITIONS
and PERIPHRASIS. It should be clearly
admitted, however, that there is some-
times no objection to the words; this
is when they are least of a formula and
c. has a real meaning (Buses run i. c. w.
the trains; The isolated phrase may
sound offensive, but taken i. c. w. its
context it was not so). In the prevalent
modern use, however, it is worn
down into a mere compound preposi-
tion, with vagueness and pliability as
its only merits. The worst writers
use it, from sheer love of verbiage, in
preference to a single word that
would be more appropriate (The
three outstanding features i. c. w. [i.e. of]
our 'Batchworth Tinted', as sample set
enclosed, are as follows). The average
writer is not so degraded as to choose
it for its own sake, but he has not
realized that when i. c. w. presents itself
to him it is a sign that laziness is
mastering his style, or haziness his
ideas. Of the examples that follow, the
first two are characteristic specimens of
compound-prepositional periphrasis :
The special difficulty in Professor Mino-
celsi's case arose i. c. w. the view he holds
relative to the historical value of . . .
(Prof. M. was specially hampered by
consensus
his views on). / Regulations with regard
to the provision of free places i. c. w.
secondary education (Regulations for
providing free places in secondary
schools). / The general secretary ex-
pressed his disgust i. c. w. the award, and
said his executive would have to con-
sider what further steps should be taken
i. c. w. pursuing their claim (Disgust at
the award : steps to pursue their claim).
connoisseur. Pronounce kontser';
the modern French spelling (-nai-)
should not be used.
connote, denote. Both mean to sig-
nify, but with a difference. A word
denotes its primary meaning—its bar-
est adequate definition; it connotes the
attributes commonly associated with
it. For instance father denotes one
that has begotten; it connotes male
sex, prior existence, greater experience,
affection, guidance, etc.: ugly denotes
what is unpleasing to our sight; it
connotes repellent effect, immunity
from the dangers peculiar to beauty,
disadvantage in the marriage market,
etc. Connote is sometimes used (loosely
says the COD) in the sense of denote,
i.e. 'mean', but the differentiation is
worth preserving.
conscience. See SAKE.
consecutive. A c. clause is a subordi-
nate clause that expresses the conse-
quence of the fact stated in the sen-
tence on which it depends; and a c.
conjunction, in English that corre-
sponding to a preceding 50 or such, is
the word joining such a clause to the
sentence (He was so angry that he
could not speak). Some grammarians,
however, would call this example an
adverbial clause of degree, and confine
the term consecutive to such a sentence
as He was angry, so that we were glad
to get away.
consensus means unanimity, or un-
animous body, of opinion or testimony.
The following quotation, in which it
is confused with census, is nonsense:
Who doubts that if a consensus were
c o n s e q u e n t i a l 106
taken, in which the interrogated had
the honesty to give a genuine reply, zve
should have an overwhelming major-
ity? The misspelling concensus is
curiously common.
consequential is a word severely re-
stricted in its application by modern
idiom; it is unidiomatic in several of
the senses that it might have or has
formerly borne.
1. Where doubt can arise between it
and consequent, the latter should always
be used when the sense is the simple
and common one of resulting, and -ial
be reserved for that of required for con-
sistency with something else. Thus In the
consequent confusion he vanished, but
The consequential amendments were
passed. Consequential confusion is not
English; the consequent amendments is,
but means not (as with -ial) those
necessitated byonepreviouslyaccepted,
but those that resulted from (e.g.) the
opposition's hostility or the discovery
of a flaw. The right use is seen in A
good many of these undiscussed changes
were only consequential alterations and
the wrong one in The anomalies that
flow from present law, and the conse-
quential state of confusion created in the
public mind on particular occasions, are
evidence that the Act is a bad one. But
the following sentence (in which conse-
quent would be better, but either is
possible) shows that the line is some-
times hard to draw : Yet whilst he washes
his hands of the methods of the Albert
Hall, with its consequential campaign of
resistance and its cry of ''no servant tax',
he declares that the Bill must not be
passed.
2 . C. does not mean of consequence ;
a c. person may or may not be impor-
tant; all we know is that he is self-
important; Air. C. bustled about, feeling
himself the most c. man in the town would
not now be English.
3. C. does not now mean having
great consequences. For so desperate
and so c. a war as this there should be
substituted a war so desperate and so
pregnant with consequences.
4 . C. damage is damage that is conse-
quent on an act but not the direct and
immediate result of it.
considerable
conservative. The use of this word as
an epithet, in the sense of moderate,
safe, or low, with estimates, figure,
etc., originating in U.S., is now firmly
established in Britain also—too firmly,
indeed, for it promotes forgetfulness
of those simpler words, which would
generally serve as well or better.
conservatoire, conservatory. The
French, German, and Italian musical
institutions are best called by their
native names—conservatoire, conserva-
torium, conservatorio. In England the
use of conservatory in this sense has
disappeared, and such an institution is
called an Academy, a College, or a
School, of Music.
consider. Salvat considers Bruce Tul-
loh and Gordon Pirie, if he runs in this

Though they suddenly feared the Afri-
can, they felt a repulsion sharp as their
own fear at the idea that they might

regard as an evil force etc. Under
REGARD 3 numerous examples are given
of the use of that word without as, on
the analogy of consider (e.g. He regards
the public interest taken in the current
rivalry of Democratic candidates for the
nomination responsible). The quotations
given above seem to show that regard
is now beginning to have its revenge
by corrupting the idiom of consider.
considerable. 1 . C. in the sense a
good deal of is applied in British use
only to immaterial things (/ have given

considerateness, consideration.
Consideration, so far as it is compar-
able with -ateness, means thought for
others, while -ateness means the char-
acteristic of taking such thought; see
-ION AND -NESS. Sometimes therefore
it does not matter which is used (He
showed the greatest -ateness or -ation;
Thanks for your -ateness or -ation).
But more often one is preferable : His
-ateness is beyond all praise; I was
treated with -ation; He was struck by
the -ateness of the offer.
The official cliché under consideration,
now, it seems, so well worn as to need
reinforcement by an adjective such as
active, earnest, serious, is apt, like all
clichés, to make its users forget the
simple way of saying what needs to be
said. It has not yet been decided when

consistence, -cy. See -CE, -CY. The
-cy form is now invariable in the noun
that means being consistent, i.e. not
inconsistent (-cy is an overrated virtue).
In the noun meaning degree of thick-
ness in liquids usage varies; A -ce
something like that of treacle, and Mud
varying in -cy and temperature, are both
from T. H. Huxley; it would be well if
-ce could be made the only form in this
107 construct
sense, as -cy in the other. It is some-
times doubtful now whether freedom
from inconsistency is meant or meta-
phorical solidity; among the OED
quotations are : Reports begin to acquire
strength and -ce; A vague rumour daily
acquiring -cy and strength. The removal
of such doubt would be one of the
advantages of the limitation proposed
above for -ce. But the present trend
seems to be towards using -cy for all
purposes.

nouncing this word with the accent on

construct, construe, translate, with
reference to language. To translate is
to reproduce the meaning of a passage
in another language, or sometimes in
another and usually a more intelligible
style of the same language. To construe
is to exhibit the grammatical structure
of a passage, either by translating closely
or by analysis, and so it is often tanta-
mount to translate or interpret. A sense
c o n s t r u c t i v e 108
cf construe formerly common is that in
which construct is taking its place
(Prohibit should not be constructed, or
construed, with an infinitive). The older
pronunciation of construe (for which
conster was long the prevalent form)
is kô'nstrôô; the kônstrôô' now often
heard is no doubt due to the NOUN-
AND-VERB-ACCENT tendency.
constructive, i . In legal and quasi-
legal use is applied to an act that,
while it does not answer to the legal
definition of what constitutes that act
(c. trust, notice, malice, etc.), is seen
when the true construction is put upon
its motive or tendency to be equivalent
to such an act.
2 . A use of c. that has become very
popular is as an antonym of destructive.
It is specially associated with criticism :
authors and politicians whose works
and deeds meet with disapproval pro-
test indignantly that they would have
welcomed c. criticism, meaning per-
haps praise. The exhortation to be c.
is becoming a parrot-cry; and the word
is often used as a cliché that contributes
nothing to the sense : The Foreign Office
proposes to put forward a c. suggestion
for dealing zvith the situation in Laos.

aries now give it full recognition : after
all, it is an ancient and valuable right
of the English people to turn their
nouns into verbs when they are so
minded. Now that the word has settled
down as a verb, we shall no doubt get
into the habit of accenting the second
syllable. See NOUN AND VERB ACCENT.
contemporary. The Progressive Party
is the only political party in South Africa
which is contemporary; all the others,
including the Liberal Party, are genuine
antiques. If we are to believe the OED,
which tells us that the adjective c.
means 'living or existing or occurring
together in time', this sentence is mani-
fest nonsense. The fact is that c. is
being more and more used in the sense
not of contemporary with some other
specified person or event but with the
user of the word—a needless synonym
for present day. It is not difficult to see
reflected in their choice either their oivn
sentimental attachment to the past or
ruthless preference for the c. / ' Strip the
Willow' has scraps and glimmers of c.
meaning; 'The Duchess of Malfi1 has not.
From this it is a small step to give it the
meaning of modern, up-to-date, abreast
of the times, almost as good indeed as
that much-favoured adjective AVANT-
GARDE. If this misuse goes on, c. will
lose its proper meaning altogether, and
no one who reads, say, that Twelfth
Night is to be produced with contem-
porary incidental music will think the
sentence capable of any other meaning
than that the music will be by a living
composer.
contemptible, contemptuous. Air.
Sherman, speaking in the Senate, called
the President a demagogue who contemp-
tibly disregarded the Government, be-
cause President Wilson, speaking at
Columbia yesterday, said an Inter-
national Labour Conference would be
held at Washington, whether the Treaty
was ratified or not. Mr. Sherman prob-
ably meant, and not improbably said,
contemptuously. What is done con-
temptuously may be regarded as con-
temptible by the person to whom it is
done: the right word may depend on
content 109 continuance
the point of view. Either might have
been used in The judges described the
increase of their salaries provided for in
the Bill before Parliament as contemp-
tuous; i.e. to the judges the offer seemed
so contemptible that Parliament must
have been contemptuous in making it.

content, v. C. oneself with (not by) is
the right form of the phrase that means
not go beyond some course; the fol-
lowing are wrong : We must c. ourselves
for the moment by observing that from
the juridical stand-point the question is
a doubtful one. / The petition contents
itself by begging that the isolation laws
may be carried out.
content(ment). The two forms now
mean practically the same, contentment
having almost lost its verbal use ( The
contentment of his wishes left him un-
happy) and meaning, like content, con-
tented state. Contentment is the usual
word, content surviving chiefly in to
heart's content and as a poetic or rhe-
torical variant.
content(s), what is contained. The
OED says 'The stress conte'nt is his-
torical, and still common among the
educated'. But the stress co'ntent due,
no doubt, to the wish to differentiate
from content = contentment, has now
become the usual pronunciation in
both singular and plural.

continental. 'Your mother,' said Mr.
Brownlow to Mr. Monks in Oliver
Twist, 'wholly given up to continental
frivolities, had utterly forgotten the
young husband ten years her junior.'
This use of continental reflects the
common belief in England that the
Continent, especially France, offers
unwonted opportunities for gaiety and
self-indulgence. It persists in such
expressions as c. Sunday, c. cabaret,
now not necessarily in the pejorative
sense intended by Mr. Brownlow but
suggesting either envy or reprobation,
or a mixture of both, according to the
taste of the user. Such feelings to-
ward what we suppose to be the con-
tinental way of life have no doubt
changed with the mellowing of
Victorian prudery, but are unlikely
to disappear so long as we are not
allowed to gamble where we please or to
drink whenever we are so disposed.
continual, continuous. That is -al
which either is always going on or re-
curs at short intervals and never comes
(or is regarded as never coming) to an
end. That is -ous in which no break
occurs between the beginning and the
(not necessarily or even presumably
long-deferred) end.
continuance, continuation, con-
tinuity. Continuance has reference to
continue in its intransitive senses of last,
go on; continuation to continue in its
transitive senses of prolong, go on with,
and (in the passive) be gone on with.
Choice between the two is therefore
open when the same sense can be got
at from two directions ; We hope for a
-ance of your favours means that we
hope they will continue; We hope for a
-ation of them means that we hope you
will continue them; and these amount
to the same thing. But the addition that
continues a tale or a house is its -ation,
not its -ance, and the time for which
the pyramids have lasted is their -ance,
not their -ation; we can wait for a
-ation, but not for a -ance, of hostili-
ties; and, generally speaking, the dis-
tinction has to be borne in mind.
Continuity, though occasionally con-
fused with continuance, is less liable to
misuse, and it is enough to say that its
reference is not to continue, but to con-
tinuous. The continuity man or girl in
the film studio, who joins up scenes so
as to make a continuous story, is rightly
so called. For solution of continuity see
POLYSYLLABIC HUMOUR.
contradictious
contradictious, -tory. The meanings
given to contradicting, captious, cavil-
ling, cantankerous, quarrelsome, do not
belong to contradictory ; if either word
is to be used, it must be -tious', but this,
though not in fact a new word, is al-
ways used with an uneasy suspicion
that it has been made as a stopgap,
and it is better to choose one of the
many synonyms.
contrary. I . The original accent
(Jkôntrâf'ï) lingers (i) with the un-
educated in all ordinary uses of the
adjective (not, perhaps, in the c.)\
(2) with most speakers in the jocose
or childish c. for perverse or peevish
{Mary, Mary, quite contrary), and in
contrariness, -ly, used similarly; (3)
with many speakers in contrariwise,
especially when it either represents on
the c. rather than in the c. manner, or
is used playfully.
2 . On the c, on the other hand. The
idiomatic sense of o. t. 0. h. is quite
clear; except by misuse (see below) it
never means far from that, i.e. it never
introduces something that conflicts
with the truth of what has preceded,
but always a coexistent truth in con-
trast with it. The following two ex-
amples should have o. t. c. instead
of o. t. 0. h.: It cannot be pleaded that
the detail is negligible; it is, o. t. 0. h.,
of the greatest importance. / The object
is not to nourish 10,000 cats by public
charity; it is, 0. t. 0. h., to put them to
sleep in the lethal chamber. An example
of the right use is : Food was abundant;
water, o. t. 0. h., was running short.
The use of 0. t. c. is less simple ; it may
have either of the senses of which o. t.
0. h. has only one; i.e. it may mean
either on the other hand or far from that',
but if it stands first in its sentence it
can only mean far from that. Thus
Food was abundant; 0. t. c, water was
running short is impossible; but Food
was abundant; water, 0. t. c, was running
short is not incorrect, though o. t. 0. h.
is commoner and, with a view to future
differentiation, preferable. If 0. t. c. is
to stand first, it must be in such forms
as Food was not abundant; 0. t. c, it
was running short.
no contumely
contrary,converse,opposite.These
are sometimes confused, and occasion-
ally precision is important. If we take
the statement All men are mortal, its
contrary is Not all men are mortal, its
converse is All mortal beings are men,
and its opposite is No men are mortal.
The contrary, however, does not ex-
clude the opposite, but includes it as
its most extreme form. Thus This is
white has only one opposite, This is
black, but many contraries, as This is
not white, This is coloured, This is dirty,
This is black ; and whether the last form
is called the contrary, or more emphati-
cally the opposite, is usually immaterial.
But to apply the opposite to a mere con-
trary (e.g. to / did not hit him in relation
to / hit him, which has no opposite), or
to the converse (e.g. to He hit me in
relation to / hit him, to which it is
neither contrary nor opposite), is a
looseness that may easily result in mis-
understanding. The temptation to go
wrong is intelligible when it is remem-
bered that with certain types of sen-
tence (A exceeds B) the converse and
the opposite are identical(B exceeds A).
contrast. 1 . Pronounce the noun

-en verbs from adjectives. It being
no part of most people's business to
inquire into such matters, the average
writer would probably say, if asked for
an offhand opinion, that from any ad-
jective of one syllable an -en verb could
be formed meaning to make or become
so-and-so. That, at any rate, was
roughly the position taken up by one
party to a newspaper controversy some
years ago on the merits of quieten. A
very slight examination shows it to be
remote from the facts; -en cannot be
called a living suffix. There are on the
one hand some 50 -en verbs whose cur-
rency is beyond question; on the other
hand as many adjectives may be found
that, though they look as fit as the 50
for turning into verbs by addition of .
159 -en verbs from adjectives
-en, no one would dream of treating in
that way. Some of them are allowed to
become verbs without the -en {lame,
wet, blind, foul); others have to go
without a cognate verb {grand, wise,
sore); others have their beginning
operated on instead of their end (large
and enlarge, fine and refine, new and
renew, plain and explain, strange and
estrange, dense and condense)', and the
despotism of usage is still clearer when
it is noticed that we can say moisten but
not wetten, quicken but not slowen,
thicken and fatten but not thinnen and
leanen, deafen but not blinden, sweeten
but not souren, sharpen but not blunten,
cheapen but not dearen, freshen but not
stolen, coarsen but not finen. Between
the two sets of adjectives whose mind
is made up, some taking and some
refusing -en, there are a few about
which questions may arise. With some
the right of the -en verb to exist is
disputable, and with others the un-
doubted existence of two verbs (e.g.
loo^e and loosen), one being identical
with the adjective and one having -en,
raises the question of differentiated
senses; and some remarks may be
offered on each. The following is the
list, thought to be fairly complete, of
the ordinary -en verbs, not including
anomalous ones like strengthen, nor
any whose right to exist is dubious:
blacken, brighten, broaden, cheapen,
coarsen, darken, deaden, deafen, deepen,
fasten, fatten, flatten, freshen, gladden,
harden, harshen, lessen, liken, lighten,
loosen, louden, madden, moisten, quicken,
redden, ripen, roughen, sadden, sharpen,
shorten, sicken, slacken, smarten, soften,
steepen, stiffen, straighten, straiten,
sweeten, tauten, thicken, tighten, tough-
en, weaken, whiten, widen, worsen.
The debatable words are:
black and blacken: the second is the
wider word used for most purposes,
black being confined to the sense put
black colour upon, besides being only
transitive except when used with out,
meaning to suffer a momentary loss of
consciousness. You black boots, glass,
someone else's eye, or your own face,
and black out a passage as censor or
a building to prevent light inside it
-en verbs from adjectives
from being seen outside. You blacken
a character; stone blackens or is
blackened with age.
brisken: not in OED originally, but
included in the 1933 Supp. with quota-
tions from 1799. Not in current use.
dampen: old in English, but 'now
chiefly U.S.' (OED) and a SUPER-
FLUOUS WORD.
fat and fatten: the first is chiefly
archaic, kept alive by the fatted calf,
but also survives as a business word
in cattle-breeding circles ; fatten is the
ordinary word.
glad and gladden : gladden is now the
ordinary word, but to glad is still in
poetical use, and is familiar in Moore's
'I never nursed a dear gazelle
To glad me with its soft black eye . . . '
greaten: 'now archaic' (OED); but a
word formerly much used.
liven : a modern word used (generally
with up) as a more colloquial synonym
of enliven, and also intransitively.
loose and loosen : the broad distinction
is that loose means undo or set free
(opposite to bind), and loosen means to
make looser (opposite to tighten).
mad and madden : mad was formerly
much used, especially as intransitive
in the sense act madly. This is now
obsolete, so that 'far from the madding
crowd', which is an example of it in
Gray's line 'Far from the madding
crowd's ignoble strife', is perhaps
generally taken in the mutilated form
to which Thomas Hardy gave currency
to mean far from the distracting crowd.
The only present function of to mad is
to supply a poetical synonym for mad-
den, which has suffered from wear and
tear as a trivial exaggeration for annoy.
olden: this had a vogue during the
19th c. in the sense make or become
older in looks or habits, and was an
especial favourite of Thackeray's ; but,
with to age well established, it is a
SUPERFLUOUS WORD and has rightly
fallen into disuse.
quiet and quieten : quiet as a verb dates
from 1440 at least, and appears in the
Prayer Book, Shakespeare, Burke, and
Macaulay, besides many good minor
writers; it is both transitive and in-
transitive. For quieten, perhaps the
160 envisage
only -en verb from an adjective of more
than one syllable, the most authorita-
tive name quoted by the OED is Mrs.
Gaskell. Its inflexions (quietened, quiet-
ening, etc.) are ugly, and it should have
been dismissed as a SUPERFLUOUS WORD
instead of being allowed to usurp the
place of the older one. The favour now
shown to it is perhaps attributable not
so much to a preference for it over
quiet as to ignorance that quiet is a verb.
right and tighten: to right is estab-
lished, and righten (called 'rare' by the
OED, though used occasionally from
the 14th c. on) is a SUPERFLUOUS WORD.
rough and roughen: both are in full
use, with some idiomatic differentia-
tion, though often either will do; see
ROUGH(EN).
slack and slacken: as rough(eri); see
SLACK(EN).
smooth and smoothen : the OED gives
numerous examples of smoothen, each
of which, however, makes one wonder
afresh why on earth (except sometimes
metri gratia) the writer did not content
himself with smooth', smoothen had
clearly a vogue in the early 19th c ,
but is now a SUPERFLUOUS WORD.
stout and stouten : stout occurs only in
special senses, and is archaic; stouten
also is now rare.
white and whiten : to white is perhaps
only used in echoes of 'whited sepul-
chres' and of 'as no fuller on earth can
white them'.
worsen, though some writers may
shy at it and reluctantly prefer deterio-
rate in the intransitive sense, is quoted
from Milton, George Eliot, and others,
and is now common and unexception-
able.

two pronunciations ënvïr'onz, ë'nvïr-

FORMAL WORD for face, confront, con-
template, imagine, intend, recognize,
realize, viezv, visualize, and regard. In
the sense of forming a mental picture
of something that may exist in the
future (In making these proposals I am
envisaging a completely modernized rail-
way system), e. may no doubt express
its user's intention better than any of
the other words, but such occasions
must indeed be rare in comparison
with those in which it is a pretentious
substitute for one of them.
epic. The proper use of this word is
of a narrative poem celebrating the
achievements of some heroic person
of history or tradition and suggesting
the Homeric or Miltonic muse. It has
been debased by SLIPSHOD EXTENSION,
especially at the hands of film pro-
ducers, who seem to use it as a catch-
word to describe any story told on the
screen that they hope the public will
find exciting. FABULOUS HOLLY-
WOOD EPICS! And (to quote The
Times) 'it is the present fashion to label
as "epic" any play whose anti-hero in
the jargon of the time, heroes being
"old hat", meanders through countless
untidy little scenes of squalid life'.
Gossip writers also like to use it when
they feel the need of a change from

epicene. Having no real function
in English grammar, the word (n. and
adj.) is kept alive chiefly in contemp-
tuous use, implying physical as well
as moral sexlessness; for this purpose
it is better suited than common or
neuter owing to their familiarity in
other senses.
Epicurean. See HEDONIST.
epidemic. See ENDEMIC.
epigram. Literally con-writing'. Four
distinct meanings, naturally enough de-
veloped. First, now obsolete, an in-

of with in correlation with equally
(Hermes is patron of poets equally as
Apollo) is a relic of the time when
equally with had not been established
and writers were free (as with many
other correlative pairs) to invent their
own formulae.
2 . The use of equally as instead of
either equally or as by itself is an il-
literate tautology, but one of which it
is necessary to demonstrate the fre-
quency, and therefore the danger, by
quotation. These should be corrected
by using equally alone where a com-
parison is not expressed within the
sentence, and as alone where it is.
The labour crisis has furnished evidence

some respects equally (as) inequitable. /
Surely actors* working conditions are

ment. But sentences in which equally
as is used to signify precise numerical
equality may need more radical altera-
tion: The expansion of the Canadian
labour force will be equally as large as in

equat(e)(ion). 'The not distinguish-
ing where things should be distin-

not confounding where things should
be confounded, is the cause of all the
mistakes in the world.' Anyone ex-
pressing the same sentiment today
would probably say 'the equating of
things that ought not to be equated'
and so on; equate is now the VOGUE
WORD for treat as equivalent, fail to
distinguish between, confound.

equivocation.

-er and -est, more and most. Neg-
lect or violation of established usage
with comparatives and superlatives
sometimes betrays ignorance, but more
often reveals the repellent assumption
that the writer is superior to conven-
tions binding on the common herd.
The remarks that follow, however, are
not offered as precise rules, but as ad-
vice that, though generally sound, may
on occasion be set aside.
1. The normal -er and -est adjectives.
2 . Other common -er and -est adjec-
tives. 3. -er and -est in adverbs. 4. Ad-
jectives tolerating -est but not -er.
5. Stylistic extension of -er and -est.
6. Emotional -est without the. 7. Super-
lative in comparisons of two. 8. Com-
paratives misused. 9. Superlatives
misused.
1. The adjectives regularly taking
-er and -est in preference to more and
most are (a) all monosyllables (hard,
sage, shy, etc.); (b) disyllables in -y
(holy, lazy, likely, etc.)» in -le (noble,
subtle, etc.), in -er (tender, clever, etc.),
in -ow (narrow, sallow, etc.) ; (c) many
disyllables with accent on the last
(polite, profound, etc.; but not an-
tique, bizarre, or the predicative
adjectives afraid, alive, alone, aware) ;
(d) trisyllabic negative forms of (b) and
(c) words (unholy, ignoble, etc.).
2 . Some other disyllables in every-
day use, not classifiable under termi-
nations, as common, cruel, pleasant, and
quiet (but not constant, sudden, etc.)
prefer -er and -est. And many others,
e.g. awkward, brazen, buxom, crooked,
can take -er and -est without disagree-
ably challenging attention.
3. Adverbs not formed with -ly from
adjectives, but identical in form with
their adjectives, use -er and -est
-er and -est 164 -er and -est
naturally (runs faster, sleeps sounder,
hits hardest, hold it tighter); some
independent adverbs, as soon, often,
do the same; -ly adverbs, though
comparatives in *-lier are possible in
archaic and poetic style (wiselier said,
softlier nurtured), now prefer more
wisely etc.
4 . Many adjectives besides those de-
scribed in 1 and 2 are capable in ordi-
nary use, i.e. without the stylistic taint
illustrated in 5 and 6, of forming a
superlative in -est, used with the and
serving as an emphatic form simply,
while no one would think of making a
comparative in -er from them: in the
brutalest, civilest, timidest, cheerfullest,
cunningest, doggedest, damnablest, man-
ner. The termination s "that most invite
this treatment are -ful, -ing, -able, -ed,
and -id; on the other hand the very
common adjective terminations -ive,
-ic, and -ous, reject it altogether
(curiouser and curiouser is a product of
Wonderland). Though it is hard to
draw a clear line between this use and
the next, the intent is different. The
words are felt to be only slightly less
normal, and yet appreciably more
forcible, than the forms with most;
they are superlatives only, and em-
phasis is their object.
5. As a stylistic device, based on
NOVELTY-HUNTING, and developing
into disagreeable mannerism, it was
once the fashion to extend the use of
-er and -est to many adjectives nor-
mally taking more and most, and the
reader got pulled up at intervals by
beautifuller, delicater, ancientest, dili-
gentest, delectablest, dolefuller, devoted-
est, admirablest, and the like. The trick
served Carlyle's purpose, but grew
tiresome in his imitators and is no
longer popular. The extreme form of
it is shown in the next paragraph.
6. The emotional -est without the.
For In Darkest Africa it may perhaps
be pleaded that the title was deliber-
ately chosen for its emotional content.
But such a sentence as Mile Nau, an
actress of considerable technical skill and
a valuable power of exhibiting deepest
emotion is so obviously critical and
unemotional that it shows fully the
VULGARIZATION of a use that is appro-
priate only to poetic contexts. In
so analytic a mood the critic should
have been content with deep emotion.
If he had been talking descriptively, he
might have gone as far as 'she exhibited
the deepest emotion' ; but not unless he
had been apostrophizing her in verse
as 'deepest emotion's Queen', or by
whatever lyric phrase emotion (and not
analysis) might have inspired, should
he have dared to cut out his the and
degrade the idiom sacred to the poets.
Not that he is a solitary or original
sinner; half the second-rate writers on
art and literature seem to think they
have found in this now hackneyed de-
vice an easy way of exhibiting intense
but restrained feeling.
Other examples : The problem is not
one of Germany alone; many of the
other States which were in the Central
Alliance are in worst plight for food, so
far as can be gathered. / . . . addressed
the Senate, declaring that widest diver-
sity of opinion exists regarding theforma-
tion of a League of Nations. / An

est interest among all civilized peoples,
and to mark a really new epoch in the
story of democracy. / But Stoddard did
not strike the local note, whereas Sted-
man could tell of Stuyvesant and the
"Dutch Patrol" in pleasantest fashion
and in accordance with the very tone of
the Irving tradition, j Mr. Vanderlip is,
therefore, in closest touch with the
affairs of international finance.
If the reader will be good enough to
examine these one by one, he will cer-
tainly admit this much—that such
superlatives are, for better or worse,
departures from custom, and that in
each sentence a change from ' est'
to '(a) very ' or 'the most ' or
'the est' would be a return to
normal English. If he will next try
to judge, from all the specimens
taken together, what effect is pro-
duced by this artifice, it may be
hoped, though less confidently, that
he will agree with the following
view. The writers have no sense of
congrufty (see INCONGRUOUS VOCABU-
-er and -est
LARY), and are barbarically adorning
contexts of straightforward business-
like matter with ill-judged scraps
of more exalted feeling; the impres-
sion on sensitive readers is merely that
of a queer simulated emotionalism.
7. Superlative in comparisons of
two. They were forced to give an
answer which was not their real answer
but only the nearest to it of two al-
ternatives. This use of -est instead of
-er where the persons or things com-
pared are no more than two should
normally be avoided; the raison d'être
of the comparative is to compare two
things, and it should be allowed to do
its job without encroachment by the
superlative. Nearer should have been
used in the example given. But excep-
tions must be admitted. Use of the
comparative instead of the superlative
would be pedantry in such phrases as
Put your best foot foremost; May the
best man win; Get the best of both
worlds; and who would wish thus to
weaken Milton's Whose God is strong-
est, thine or mine?
8. Certain illogicalities to which the
comparative lends itself may be
touched upon. For Don't do it more
than you can help see HELP. Better
known than popular is cured by resolv-
ing better into more well. It is more or
less—and certainly more than less—a
standardized product is a case of CAN-
NIBALISM, one of the necessary two
mores having swallowed the other.
Unwise striving after double emphasis

nothing worse than give himself away

cussed under ILLOGICALITIES.

daughters Eve is still with us: see I L -

trasted pair of mistakes ; the first is of
anotorious type (for examples see NUM-
BERS), and the second looks almost as

-er and -or. 1. The agent termina-
tion -er can be added to any existing
English verb ; but with many verbs the
regular agent-noun ends in -or and
that in -er is occasional only; with
others both forms are established with
or without differentiation of sense;
see -OR.
2 . When -er is added to verbs in -y
following a consonant, y is ordinarily
changed to i {occupier, carrier); but
y is retained between a vowel and -er
(player, employer, buyer). But mono-
syllabic verbs in -y are capricious in
this respect. See DRY.
E r a s t i a n i s m . See JANSENISM.
ere. See INCONGRUOUS VOCABULARY,
and VULGARIZATION. Ere can still be
used with effect if the atmosphere is
right (It is so easy to talk of 'passing
emotion' and to forget how vivid the emo-
tion was ere it passed), but in all ordi-
nary prose before should be preferred;
the following quotations show the fish
out of water at its unhappiest: The
iniquitous anomaly of the plural voter

older. ( As many people may be aware,

comes round. / In the opinion of high

ergo (Latin for therefore) is archaic or
obsolete in serious use, but still serves

tiously to the illogical nature of a con-
clusion : He says it is too hot for any-
thing; ergo, a bottle of Bass. See
PEDANTIC HUMOUR.
Eros. We talk erotics more than we
did, and there is an Eros that all
Londoners have seen; so the name has
erratum
a future before it, and its pronuncia-
tion matters. The Greek word, in Eng-
lish mouths, is ë'rôz, but the OED
Supp., putting ër'âs first, reflects the
Londoners' choice. It is no worse than
Socrates, Nêro, Plâto, and many other
classical names that we pronounce

ersatz. This word for a substitute

was borrowed from Germany at the
time of the first world war. We had
no real need of it—we have our own

a time must have been due to that

VOCABULARY
escalate. Undeclared war between
India and China has escalated sharply
during the past few days. / The President
chose to begin with one of the less
drastic options, leaving open the pos-
sibility of escalation to more violent
ones. Escalate, a recent BACK-FORMA-
TION from escalator (both originally
U.S.) was not needed; escalade (n.
and vb.) has long been in similar
metaphorical use. But -ate is likely to
drive -ade out; it has the advantage of
novelty and a more native look, and a
moving staircase provides a more up-
to-date metaphor than a scaling
ladder.
escap(ee) (ism) (ist). Escapism and
escapist, for those who would escape
from reality into fantasy, are words
too recent to be in the OED Supp.;
they are no doubt a natural product
of the atomic age. Cf. WISHFUL think-
ing. Escapee, whose French form
(see -EE) is said to be due to its
having been originally applied to
French convicts from New Caledonia

e s p e c i a l l y ) . i.(E)special(ly). 2. Es-
pecially with inversion. 3. Especially
as. 4 . More especially.
1. (E)special(ly). The characteristic
sense of the longer adjective and ad-
verb is pre-eminence or the particular
as opposed to the ordinary, that of the
others being limitation or the particu-
lar as opposed to the general. There is,
however, a marked tendency in the
adjectives for especial to disappear and
for special to take its place. It may be
said that special is now possible in all
senses, though especial is still also pos-
sible or preferable in the senses (a) ex-
ceptional in degree, as My especial
friend is Jones; He handles the matter
with especial dexterity ; Oxford architec-
ture receives especial attention, (b) of or
for a particular person or thing speci-
fied by possessive adjective or case, as
For my or Smith's especial benefit; For
the especial benefit of wounded soldiers.
In the adverbs the encroachments of
the shorter form are more limited; a
writer may sometimes fall into saying
The reinforcements arrived at a specially
critical moment, where an especially
would be better, but it is as little
allowable to say The candidates, spe-
cially those from Scotland, showed
ability as it is to say Candidates must
be especially prepared or An arbitrator
was especially appointed. Two examples
follow of especially used where specially
is clearly meant; in both the sense is
not to an exceptional degree, but for
one purpose and no other : The founder
of the movement will be especially inter-
viewed for the ten o'clock news, f Agree-
able features of the book will be the
illustrations, including a number of
reproductions of prints especially lent.
2 . Especially with inversion. The
word is a favourite with victims of
this craze (see INVERSION): Springs
of mineralized water, famous from
Roman times onwards; especially did
they come into renown during the
nineteenth century. / Mr. Campbell does
not recognize a change of opinion, but
espionage 167
frankly admits a change of emphasis;
especially is he anxious at the present
time to advance the cause of Liberal
Evangelism.
3. Especially as. It is worth notice
that of the causal as-clauses discussed
in AS 2 some types intolerable in them-
selves are made possible by the inser-
tion of especially before as: I shall have
to ask for heavy damages, as my client's
circumstances are not such as to allow of
quixotic magnanimity. As by itself is,
as usual, insufficient to give the re-
mainder of the sentence the fresh push-
off that the introduction of an unfore-
seen consideration requires; but espe-
cially inserted before as, by bespeaking
attention, prevents the tailing off into
insignificance that would have ruined
the balance.
4. More especially is a common form
of TAUTOLOGY. Some showers may de-
velop more especially in the eastern
counties. Especially is quite capable of
doing the job by itself.
espionage. Es'pïônïj, -ahzh, -âj and
espï'ônïj all have some dictionary
authority. Preference is recommended
in that order.
esplanade. Pronounce -âd not -ahd
(unlike promenade). See -ADE, -ADO.
esquire was originally a title of func-
tion; the esquire was the attendant of
the knight and carried his gear. It
later became a title of rank, inter-
mediate between knight and gentleman,
the right to which is still denned by
law in a way that to modern ideas is in
some respects curious. Barristers are
esquires (at any rate after they have
taken silk; there seems some doubt
about the outer bar), but solicitors are
never more than mere gentlemen;
justices of the peace are esquires
but only while they are in the Com-
mission. A class of esquires that
must by now be of considerable
size is that of the eldest sons of
knights and their eldest sons and so
on in perpetuity. But the impossi-
bility of knowing who is an esquire and
who not, combined with a reluctance
essence and substance
to draw invidious distinctions, has
deprived esquire of all significance,
and it looks as though one odd
product of the Century of the
Common Man might be to promote
the whole adult male population to this
once select and coveted status.

ASSAY.
2 . The verb is accented on the last
syllable ; the noun, in its now common-
est sense of a kind of literary piece, on
the first. But in the wider and now
rare sense of an attempt the old accent
on the last may still be heard; that it
was formerly so accented is evident
from Unes like Whose first essay was in
a tyrant's praise. / This is th' essay of my

idiosyncrasy 262
pity that it is often used as a poly-
syllabic substitute for various things
that have good simple names of their
own; it is both pretentious and absurd
to say that so-and-so is one of your
idiosyncrasies when you mean one of
your habits, ways, fads, whims, fancies,
or peculiarities. In each of the follow-
ing quotations a more suitable word is
suggested : It is an idiosyncrasy of this
grumbler that he reads his own thoughts
into the minds of others (characteristic). /
For one reason or another—lack of
money, lack of meny sometimes the
idiosyncracies [sic] of committees—
the library has been far less useful
than it might have been to the serious
student (fads). I I do not find him,
though he is very quick in observing
outward idiosyncrasies, a truthful or an
interesting student of the characters, the
minds and hearts, the daily actions and
reactions, of men and women (peculiari-
ties). / Moreover, it [a liturgy] is desired
as a protection against the idiosyncrasies
of the minister, whether in his doctrine
or its expression (vagaries). / There are
several kinds of food freaks; some people
have an idiosyncrasy to all fish, par-
ticularly shellfish and lobsters (antipathy
or allergy).
Idiosyncratic is the adjective of idio-
syncrasy—unfortunately, because it
encourages by an accident the con-
fusion between -crasy and -cracy. If
idiosyncrasy is a word that has a real
value, but should be much less used
than it is, idiosyncratic, its hanger-on,
should be kept still more severely in
its place. The quotations show that
there is a danger of its getting more
vogue than it deserves ; what the reader
feels is not that his author has used the
word in a wrong sense—he has not—
but that he would have done better to
circumvent, somehow, the need for it:
We continue to read for much the same
reason as incites a Purple Emperor to
feed on carrion, a cat on mice, a queen
bee on nectar, the South Wind on a bank
of violets; we are in pursuit of the idio-
syncratic (ofwhat appeals to us). / What
we cannot help learning of their maker,
or discoverer—his philosophy, his idio-
syncratic view of things—is there, not
idola fori
because he wittingly put it there, but
because he could not keep it out (indivi-
dual. Here, at any rate, the writer
could have kept idiosyncratic out). / To
be thinking and pondering, roving and
exploring between the lines of a book is
a less arduous and fussy, a quieter and
more idiosyncratic enterprise (reward-
ing?). / He never hesitates at any joke,
however idiosyncratic (however little
amusing to anyone but himself?).
idola fori, idols of the market
(place). This learned phrase (pro-
nounce tdô'lâ fô'rï), in Latin or
English, is not seldom used by the un-
learned, who guess at its meaning and
guess wrong. It is a legitimate enough
phrase in writing meant for the edu-
cated only, but hardly so in the ordi-
nary newspaper, where it is certain not
to be understood by most readers, and
where it therefore tends to be given, by
SLIPSHOD EXTENSION, the false sense
that those who have never been told
what it means may be expected to
attach to it. That false sense is 'vulgar
errors' or 'popular fallacies', one of
which expressions should be used
instead of it, since it in fact has a much
more limited meaning than they, and
one not obvious without explanation
S e e POPULARIZED TECHNICALITIES.
It is the third of Bacon's four classes
of fallacies, more often mentioned
than the other three because its mean-
ing seems plainer, though it is not so
in fact. There are the idols (i.e. the
fallacies) of the tribe, the cave, the
market, and the theatre, which are
picturesque names for (1) the errors
men are exposed to by the limitations
of the human understanding (as mem-
bers of the tribe of man) ; (2) those a
person is liable to owing to his idio-
syncrasy (as enclosed in the cave of
self); (3) those due to the unstable
relation between words and their
meanings (which fluctuate as the words
are bandied to and fro in the conversa-
tional exchange or word-market)', and
(4) those due to false philosophical or
logical systems (which hold the stage
successively like plays). The tribe is
the human mind, the cave is idiosyn-
idolatry 263 -ies
crasy, the market is talk, and the
theatre is philosophy. Who would
guess all that unaided? Who, on the
contrary, would not guess that an idol
of the market-place was just any belief
to which the man in the street yields a
mistaken deference? The odd thing is
that no better instance could be found
of an idol of the market than the phrase
itself, oscillating between its real mean-
ing and the modern misuse, so that the
very person who pours scorn on idola
fori is often propagating one in the very
act of ridiculing the rest. Well, 'tis
sport to have the engineer hoist with
his own petard. The mistake is com-
mon enough, but is not easily exhibited
except in passages of some length, so
that one must here suffice; the ten-
dency to exalt the man of action above
the man of theory may be ill-advised,
but it has nothing to do with shifting
acceptations of words, and is not an
idolum fori : With us the active charac-
ters, the practical men, the individuals
who, whether in public or in private
affairs, 'get on with the job', have always
held the first place in esteem; the theorists
and philosophers a place very secondary
by comparison. It is not easy to account
for this common estimate. For one thing,
as soon as inquiry is made into it, the
belief proves to be without foundation—
just one of the idols of the market-
place.
idolatry. See -LATRY.
idyl(l). The form with -// is now
usual. The OED recognized only
one pronunciation, I-, not Ï-; on this,
however, there is room for differ-
ence of opinion. (1) It is certain that
many people say ï'dïl; (2) with idol
and idle, both commoner words, ready
to confuse the hearer, a separate pro-
nunciation is all to the good, if there is
nothing against it; and (3) it has been
pointed out in the article FALSE QUAN-
TITY that the length of the first syllable
in the Greek is nothing against its
being shortened in the English word.
Modern dictionaries recognize both.
i.e., id est. 1. To write, or even to
say, this in the full instead of in the
abbreviated form is now so unusual as
to convict one of affectation.
2 . i.e. means that is to say, and intro-
duces another way (more comprehen-
sible to the hearer, driving home the
speaker's point better, or otherwise
preferable) of putting what has been
already said. It does not introduce an
example, and when substituted for e.g.
in that function, as in the following
extract, is a blunder: Let your principal
stops be the full stop and comma, with a
judicious use of the semicolon and of the
other stops where they are absolutely
necessary (i.e. you could not dispense
with the note of interrogation in asking
questions).
3. It is invariable in form ; the chang-
ing of it to ea sunt etc.—which deals
with persons (ea sunt, all present and
future members)—is due to the same
misconception (explained under FOL-
LOW) as the incorrect as follow, cf. also
INTER ALIA.
4 . It is naturally preceded by a stop;
it should not be followed by a comma
unless the sense requires one, to intro-
duce a parenthesis for instance. He
attacked reactionaries, i.e. those whose
opinions differed from his own, but He
attacked reactionaries, i.e., it would
seem, those whose opinions etc.
-ies, -ein. Until recently the dic-
tionaries prescribed a disyllabic pro-
nunciation of -ies for words of Latin
origin such as series, species, rabies,
caries, scabies. But in fact few doctors
pronounce the second syllable of
rabies and caries differently from
that of herpes, and almost everyone
takes the same liberty with series and
species. It is better to bow to the
inevitable than to persist in a vain
attempt to preserve what we suppose
to have been the way the Romans pro-
nounced these words, and the dic-
tionaries now recognize ëz for most of
them, if only as alternatives.
Words ending ein(e) (protein, caffeine,
codeine) are rebelling in the same way,
even though they are less commonly
used; en is likely to establish itself;
modern life is too hurried for these
niceties.
if 264 if and when
if. To avoid possible ambiguity it may
be prudent to confine if to its proper
duty of introducing the protasis of a
conditional sentence, and not to use it
as a substitute for though or whether or
(with not) to introduce a possible alter-
native. Such experiences are agreeable,
if rare. (Though they are rare or only
if they are rare?) Please inform the
secretary if you intend to be present.
(Whether you intend or only if you do
intend?) He enjoyed a large, if not over-
whelming, practice in the best class of
litigation. (Though not overwhelming
or you might almost call it overwhelm-
ing?)
if and when. Any writer who uses
this formula lays himself open to en-
tirely reasonable suspicions on the part
of his readers. There is the suspicion
that he is a mere parrot, who cannot
say part of what he has often heard
without saying the rest also. There is
the suspicion that he likes verbiage for
its own sake. There is the suspicion that
he is a timid swordsman who thinks he
will be safer with a second sword in his
left hand. There is the suspicion that
he has merely been too lazy to make up
his mind between if and when. Only
when the reader is sure enough of his
author to know that in his writing none
of these probabilities can be true does
he turn to the extreme improbability
that here at last is a sentence in which
if and when is really better than if or
when by itself.
This absurdity is so common that
it seems worth while to quote some
examples, bracketing in each either
'if and' or 'and when', and asking
whether the omission would in any
way change the meaning or diminish
the force of the sentence : The Radicals
do not know quite clearly what they will
be at (if and) when the fight is renewed. /
It is to be hoped that the Labour Party,
if (and when) they come to power, will
be courageous enough to free the ether
from the bondage of commercialism. /
But if (and when) the notices are ten-
dered it will be so arranged that they all
terminate on the same day. j Mr. Mac-
millan should try to come to apreliminary
understanding with General de Gaulle
about how Britain might dispose of its
nuclear armoury if (and when) it joins the
common market. / They must, of course, be
certain that they are getting what they are
bargainingfor, but (if and) when they have
made sure of that, they would be wisely
advised to pay the price.
It was admitted above that cases were
conceivable in which the if and the when
might be genuinely and separately
significant. Such cases arise when
one desires to say that the result will
or does or did not only follow, but
follow without delay; they are not in
fact rare, and if a really good writer
allows himself an if and when, one such
must have presented itself. But in
practice he hardly ever does it even
then, because any strong emphasis on
the absence of delay is much better
given by other means, by the insertion
of at once or some equivalent in the
result clause. So true is this that, when
the devotees of if and when have had
the luck to strike a real opportunity for
their favourite, they cannot refrain
from inserting some adverb to do over
again the work that was the only true
function of their and when; in the fol-
lowing quotations these adverbs that
make and when otiose are in roman type :
The electors knew perfectly well that
if and when the Parliament Bill was
placed on the Statute-book it would
immediately be used to pass Irish Home
Rule. I If and when the Unionist Party
win a General Election we are to have at
once a general tariff on foreign manu-
factured goods. I It is true that if and
when an amendment giving women the
vote is carried this amendment is thence-
forward to become part and parcel of
the Bill.
When or if is not so purposeless as if
and when; or if does serve to express
that the writer, though he expects his

different from what is strictly in ques-

whether the law allows me to pollute

-He. In words with this suffix the
modern tendency, says the SOED, is
to pronounce -ïl, 'with some excep-
tions, in all cases'. This tendency has
continued, and many of the words
whose conventional pronunciation was
once -ïl have now -il as the preferred
or only one; these include DOCILE,
domicile, FACILE, FERTILE, FRAGILE,
missile, mobile, prehensile, servile,
STERILE, TACTILE, a n d VIRILE. ( I n
U.S. -ïl is more tenacious.) The few
that are normally pronounced -ël are
also variable ; dictionary authority can
be found for -ïl and -il in imbecile, and,
though the dictionaries recognize
nothing but -ël for automobile, ïl is
often heard. For PROFILE see that

ilk means same; it does not mean
family or kind or set or name. Of that
ilk is a form constructed for the case in
which proprietor and property have
the same name; the Knockwinnocks of
that ilk means the Knockwinnocks of
Knockwinnock. The common mal-
treatments of the phrase, some of
which are illustrated below, are partly
unconscious and due to ignorance of
the meaning of ilk, and partly face-
tious; indulgence in such WORN-OUT
HUMOUR is much less forgivable than
for an Englishman not to know what
a Scottish word means': The Walkers
are a numerous race . . . one of that ilk

walked to the Crusades, / Lord's was
simply the field rented out to the M.C.C.

calls it vulgar.
illegal, illegitimate, illicit, unlaw-
ful. These words, though largely over-
lapping, have developed certain
differentiations. Illegal is the most pre-
cise, with its meaning of contrary to
the law of the land. The scope of
illegitimate is wider; it includes not
only what is not authorized by law
but also what is against propriety or
reason, and its possible application
ranges from a child born out of wed-
lock to a deduction not justified by
premises. Illicit also covers what is
impermissible though not necessarily
illegal, including logical fallacies; in
its sense of contrary to law it is applied
especially to activities that the law
allows only subject to compliance with
certain conditions, e.g. gambling and
the manufacture and sale of alcoholic
drinks. (This meaning goes naturally
with its derivation from Lat. licere,
permit.) Unlawful, with its sweeping
implication of comprising what is for-
bidden not only by the law of the land
but also by higher authority such as
international law or divine ordinance,
is falling into disuse in common
currency.
illegible 266
illegible, unreadable. The i. is not
plain enough to be deciphered; the
u. is not interesting enough to be
perused.
illiteracies. There is a kind of offence
against the literary idiom that is not
easily named. The usual dictionary
label for some specimens of it at least
is vulg. ; but the word vulgar is now so
imbued on the one hand with social
prejudices and on the other with moral
condemnation as to be unsuitable. The
property common to these lapses seems
to be that people accustomed to read-
ing good literature do not commit
them and are repelled by them, while
those not so accustomed neither re-
frain from nor condemn them. They
may perhaps be more accurately as
well as politely called illiteracies than
vulgarisms; their chief habitat is in the
correspondence columns of the press. A
few familiar types may be here collected
for comparison, with just enough in
the way of illustration to enable each
usage to be recognized; actual quota-
tions will be found under many of the
words mentioned in their dictionary
places. See also INCOMPATIBLES and
STURDY INDEFENSIBLES. Some of the
examples listed in the former article
could equally well be classed as illitera-
cies, and the reader may think that
some of those called sturdy indefen-
sibles deserve the same sterner verdict.

illogicalities. The spread of educa-
tion adds to the writer's burdens by
multiplying that pestilent fellow the
critical reader. No longer can we de-
pend on an audience that will be satis-
fied with catching the general drift and
obvious intention of a sentence and not
trouble itself to pick holes in our word-
ing. The words used must nowadays
actually yield on scrutiny the desired
sense; to plead that anyone could see
what you meant, or so to write as to
need that plea, is not now permissible;
all our pet illogicalities will have to be
cleared away by degrees.
Though Milton might be excused or
even commended for calling Eve fairest
of her daughters, the modern newspaper
man must not expect pardon for simi-
lar conduct. Sir Ernest CasseVs Christ-
mas gift to the hospitals of £50,000 is
only the latest of many acts of splendid
munificence by which he has benefited his
fellows before now. If it is the latest of
them, says the pestilent one, it is one
of them; if one of them, it was given
before now; but it is in fact given now,
not before now; which is absurd.
Take, again, the following comment
on a quotation the commentator thinks
unjustified: Were ever finer lines per-
verted to a meaner use? We know well
enough what he is trying to do—to
emphasize the meanness of the use—
and if that had been all it would have
been better to write Never were lines
perverted to a meaner use', that com-
ment would be made weaker, not
stronger, if changed to never were fine
lines etc. and that again would be
further weakened, not strengthened,
by a change of fine to finer', everything
that narrows the field of rivals for the
illogicalities 267
distinction of meanest perversion, as
fine and finer do progressively, has an
effect contrary to what was intended.
True, in this case, it would have been
worthwhile to insert/ine, since without
it perverted lacks point ; but the change
to finer weakens the force without
adding to the accuracy. Richard I I I
says Was ever woman in this humour
won? 1 to have said Princess, or prouder
Princess, instead of woman would have
made the marvel less and not greater.
Another common, and more con-
spicuous, illogicality is the unintended
anticlimax. Masters, it is proved already
that you are little better than false
knaves, and it will go near to be thought
so shortly. Dogberry felt no uneasiness
about putting it that way, and some
writers seem to agree with him: A
scepticism about the result of military
operations which must have had and
probably has had a damping effect upon
the soldier (If it must have had, it cer-
tainly, not probably, has had).
The abandonment of blind confidence
in much less is another compliment that
will have to be paid to the modern
reader's captious logic It is still usual
to give no hearing to much more before
deciding for its more popular rival : It
is a full day's work even to open, much
less to acknowledge, all the presents. See
MUCH 2 .
A stray variety or two may now bring
this subject to an end, though it might
be treated at much greater length:
(From a notice in a public park) : Any
person not putting litter in this basket
will be liable to a fine of £5. Those who
have no litter must, it seems, go and
find some. / The schedule we shall have
to face will be a much longer one than it
would have been if we had undertaken
the work this year, and longer still than
it would have been if we had been able to
do the work last year. We may deeply
sympathize with a writer who has
brought himself to the pass of having
to choose between saying still more
longer and being illogical, but we can-
not let him off that more. / That would

supporter of the Established Church;
he would maintain, not admit, that it is

said 'what he admitted to be a griev-
ance, though it was the only one he
could see'. / The gown is not normally

image. It has been said that people
can think only in images. If that is
true it must always have been so,
and cannot by itself account for the
recent vogue of the word. This could
do the Liberals' own i. some harm in
blurring the party's distinctive theme. /

lians have invented a literary i. of them-
selves. Anyone can find half a dozen
similar examples in almost any day's
newspapers. The word, used thus,
means the 'idea'—the general im-
pression—of some person or institu-
tion received by the mind's eye of an
outsider, and the image he sees will
determine for him whether the person
is a good chap or a bad chap, the
institution a good show or a bad show.
Perhaps it is television that has done
it. Politicians and advertisers and
other advocates of themselves or their
causes can now project their images
into our very homes. This at least is
clear: that though we may not care
very much nowadays about the gift of
seeing ourselves as others see us, we
put a high value on that of persuad-
ing others to see us as we see ourselves.
'Members of the British Insurance
Association, it seems, are concerned
about the public image of the insurer.
. . . It is perfectly understandable that
insurers should want to appear, and
remain, in the best possible light vis-à-
vis their clientele. Publishers, bar-
risters, chartered accountants, and
architects probably feel the same way;
although what may be termed the
"ideal public image" may differ a bit as
between these various professions. . . .
But on one point they would all be
agreed. From the neck up the image
should be the kind of image that
inspires immediate and lasting con-
fidence.'— The Timess 29th June 1962.
The use of image in this sense does
no violence to the language. It is one
of those VOGUE WORDS (OVERALL and
PROPOSITION are others) whose mis-
chief lies not so much in misuse as in
over-use. They offer themselves as
handy reach-me-downs to people who
would do better to think exactly what
they want to say. If the writer who
said that the Government's image was
being 'undermined' had done this, he
might have expressed himself differ-
ently. See also PERSONA.
imaginary, imaginative. The
imbalance
meanings of the two are quite distinct,
and never interchangeable. That is
imaginary which exists only in some-
one's imagination; he (or his powers or
products) is imaginative who is able or
apt to form mental pictures. Any con-
fusion between the two is due to the
fact that there are things to which
either can be applied, though in differ-
ent senses, and with some such things
the distinction is not always apparent.
The difference between an imaginary
and an imaginative person is clear
enough, but that between imaginary
and imaginative distress is elusive; the
begging impostor exploits the former;
the latter is created and experienced
by the tragic or lyric poet (Such a price
The Gods exact for song, To become
what we sing). The place is described
with such wealth of detail as to lead one
to the conclusion that it must have
existed; but, of course, on the other hand,
it may have been purely imaginative.

imbalance. For several hundred
years un has been used as the negativ-
ing prefix of the verb balance and its
adjectival p.p., and when more recently
need was felt for a noun, unbalance
naturally followed. In the present
century the medical profession, espe-
cially the psychiatrists, have rejected
this word in favour of the neologism
imbalance. They may have had good
reason for wanting an esoteric word of

to say. If so they have been dis-

immanent. The word is something
of a stumbling-block; the unlearned
hearer or reader is not sure whether it
and imminent are the same or different ;
the Latin scholar feels that he does not
recall immaneo in his Cicero, and
wonders whether {-ant and -ent often

mdno may be the source instead of
mâneo. (The pronunciation immdn'ent
was prescribed for BBC announcers in
1928 'to avoid confusion with immi-
nent, but this has fallen flat.) Under
these circumstances it is thought by
some that the divines and philosophers
who chiefly affect the word should be
asked whether they would not gain in
intelligibility what they might Lose in
precision by choosing according to
context between indwelling, pervading,
pervasive, permeating, inherent, and
other words that do not mystify us.

ing philosophic and religious books,
find the word an enigma when it makes
one of its occasional appearances in the

notion of an external transcendent

i m m o r t a l , as a compliment to an
author or one of his productions or
personages, requires to be used with
caution. Its real use is to make sure
that a reader who may or may not be
an ignoramus shall realize that the
person or book referred to is well
known in the literary world, and that
without telling him the fact in too
patronizing a manner. But, delicate
as the device may originally have been,
it is now too well known to escape
notice; and whether the reader will be
offended or not depends on the exact
depth of his ignorance. There are few
who will not be angry if they are
reckoned to require 'the immortal
Shakespeare', or 'Don Quixote', or
'Pickwick Papers'; those who can put up
with 'the immortal Panurge', or 'Dob-
bin', or 'Mrs. Poyser', will be rather
more numerous; and so on in many
gradations. The author of the follow-

might have—for Don Quixote : Lovers

immunity, impunity. These words
are sometimes ignorantly confused.
Immunity means exemption from some
unpleasant or tiresome thing, as one
impassable
may become immune from small-pox

by attaining the age of 60. Impunity
means immunity from one particular
unpleasant or tiresome thing, namely
punishment.
impassable, impassible. The two
are different in derivation, spelling,
pronunciation, meaning, and currency.
The first is ultimately from Latin
pando stretch, the second from Latin
patior feel; in the first the second
syllable is (at least in Southern Eng-
land) pronounced pahs, while in the
other it is always pas; the first means
that cannot be passed, the second that
cannot feel. The first is in common
use, the second rare, having been
superseded by impassive.
impact (n.) means primarily the
striking of one thing against another, a
collision and, by extension, its effect
on the object struck. Used figuratively
in this last sense, it has become a
VOGUE WORD. There is no need to
multiply examples ; some can be found

(where the writer is referring to the

metaphor is not yet 'dead' enough
(see METAPHOR 1) to be used without
incongruity of a moving physical
object. In the second the natural word
to which i. is preferred is effect, and
in the third incidence. In the fourth i.

to be (cf. OVERALL); the omission of

singulars of indefinite amount, are
exceptions : could do with less (or fewer)
troops or clothes. Of less's antipathy to
a, examples are : / want to pay less rent,
but a lower rent is what I want. / That
is of less value, but a lower value at-
taches to this. I Less noise, please, but a
slighter noise would have waked me. /
Less size means less weight, but / want
a smaller size. Such is the general
tendency: to substitute smaller, lower,
fewer, or other appropriate word, for
less (except where it means 'a smaller
amount of), and for lesser, and to
regard the now slightly archaic less in
other senses as an affectation. There
are no doubt special phrases keeping it
alive even in quite natural speech, e.g.
in or to a less degree, where lower is
not yet as common as less; but the
general tendency is unmistakable, and
since it makes for precision, is one that
should be complied with.
•less. The original and normal use of
this suffix is to append it to nouns, so
producing adjectives meaning without
the thing, e.g. headless, tuneless; to this
use there are no limits whatever.
Words made from verbs, with the
sense not able to do or not liable to
suffer the action or process, as tireless
and fadeless, are much fewer, are
mostly of a poetical cast, and when
new-minted strike the reader, at least
of prose, as base metal. They have an
undeniable advantage in their short-
ness (compare resistless and fadeless,
with irresistible and unfadable), but
this is outweighed for all except fully
established ones by the uneasy feeling
that there is something queer about
them. Apart from a few so familiar
that no thought of their elements and
formation occurs to us, such as daunt-
less, -less words made from verbs are
much better left to the poets. This
does not apply to the many in which,
as in numberless, formation from the
noun gives the sense as well, if not as
obviously, as formation from the verb
(without number? or not able to be
numbered?); dauntless itself may per-
haps have been made from the noun
daunt, which in the 15th and 16th cc.
was current in the sense discourage-
ment.
To those who have any regard for
the interests of the language as dis-
tinguished from its pliability to their
immediate purposes, it will seem of
some importance that it should not
become necessary, with every word in
which -less is appended to what can be
either a noun or a verb, to decide
which is this time intended. If the
verb-compounds become much more
frequent, we shall never know that
pitiless and harmless may not mean
'that cannot be pitied' and 'secure
against being harmed' as well as 'with-
out the instinct of pity' and 'without
harmfulness'. We ought to be able to
assume that, with a few well-known
exceptions, -less words mean simply
without what is signified by the noun
they contain; and the way to keep that
assumption valid is to abstain from
reckless compounding of -less with
verbs.
A hyphen should not be used unless
one is necessary to sort out the three
h in one of those rare words in which
-less has been appended to a word
ending -// (the OED gives bell-less,
skill-less, smell-less, and will-less).
There is no need for one to separate
two Is, as in heelless, soulless, tailless,
etc. And it is an abuse of the hyphen
to make it serve as an indication that a
familiar compound is to be given a
meaning different from its usual one,
as in These present cause-less days.

after /. is should, or in exalted style the
pure subjunctive (/. we forget; I. he be

may, and might. The variations in the
quotations below are entirely against
modern idiom; will and would after /.
are merely a special form of the in-
ability to distinguish between SHALL

more often omitted except in formal
official communications. In those to

VOGUE WORD in distinguishing different
social classes and different grades of
officials as well as many other things.
Examples of this use can be found
ranging from the pub-and-street-corner
I. to the world I. ; though the meaning
of the latter is not easy to guess. Its
most frequent use is in connexion with
international or interdepartmental
discussion, especially in the phrases
highest {or summit) I. and appropriate I.
Thence it has spread widely and, like
most vogue words, is often a symptom
of a hazy mind that finds it more
natural to express itself in clichés than
in a straightforward way; it is habi-
tually tacked as an abstract appendage
to words that would be better without
it (see TAUTOLOGY) and sometimes
applied even to dividing lines that
would be more suitably regarded as
vertical than horizontal. At the legisla-
tive and administrative levels we are
still largely governed by a traditional
governing class. (In legislation and
administration.) / This has to await a

libel and slander. The much quoted
saying 'The greater the truth the
greater' (or 'worse') 'the libel' makes
us all occasionally curious about what
a 1. is, and how it differs from a
slander. In popular usage they are
synonymous, meaning a deliberate,
untrue, derogatory statement, usually
about a person, whether made in
writing or orally. In legal usage there
liberal
are important differences. Each is an
untrue and defamatory imputation
made by one person about another
which, if 'published' (i.e. commu-
nicated to a third person), can be a
ground for a civil action for damages.
Such an imputation is a libel if made
in permanent form (writing, pictures,
etc.) or by broadcasting. It is a slander
if made in fugitive form (e.g. by speak-
ing or gestures). A further distinction
is that an action for slander cannot
ordinarily succeed without proof that
actual damage has been caused; in an
action for libel this is unnecessary. In
both cases proof that the allegation
was true is a good defence.
Deliberate defamation of a person in
permanent form can also be treated as
a crime (criminal I.) on the ground that
it tends to provoke a breach of the
peace. A criminal 1. differs from a civil
1. in that publication to a third person
is not a necessary element in it, and
proof of its truth is not in itself a good
defence. This explains the seeming
paradox in the saying, attributed to
Lord Mansfield, quoted above. Since
1843 truth may be pleaded in defence,
but only if the accused can show also
that he acted in the public interest.
The most famous case of criminal 1.
in modern times was Oscar Wilde's
unsuccessful prosecution of Lord
Queensberry.
Popular synonyms of libel and slander
(calumny, defamation, scandal) are now
being forgotten under the influence of
the VOGUE WORD smear, which gives its
user the satisfaction of hitting back by
an imputation of baseness or cowardice
on the part of the smearer.
liberal. In /. education the adjective
retains a sense that is almost obsolete,
and yet is near enough to some extant
senses to make misunderstanding
possible. A liberal education is neither
one in which expense is not spared,
nor one in which enlightened methods
of teaching prevail, nor even one that
instils broadmindedness ; or rather it
is not so called because it is any of
these. It is the education that used to
be considered the only fitting one for

libertine 334 like

(Latin liber a free man), and is opposed

1. It will be best to dispose first of
what is, if it is a misuse at all, the
most flagrant and easily recognizable
misuse of /. A sentence from Darwin
quoted in the OED contains it in a
short and unmistakable form: Un-
fortunately few have observed L you
have done. Most people use this con-
struction daily in conversation. It is
the established way of putting the
thing among all who have not been
taught to avoid it; the substitution of
as for /. in their sentences would seem
to them artificial. But in good writ-
ing this particular /. is rare, and even
those writers with whom sound Eng-
lish is a matter of care and study
rather than of right instinct, and to
whom /. was once the natural word,
usually weed it out. The OED's
judgement is as follows: 'Used as con-
junction, = "like as", as. Now gene-
rally condemned as vulgar or slovenly,
though examples may be found in
many recent writers of standing'.
Besides the Darwin quoted above, the
like
OED gives indisputable examples
from Shakespeare, Southey, Newman,
Morris, and other 'writers of standing'.
The reader who has no instinctive
objection to the construction can now
decide for himself whether he will
consent to use it in talk, in print, in
both, or in neither. He knows that he
will be able to defend himself if he is
condemned for it, but also that, until
he has done so, he will be condemned.
It remains to give a few newspaper
examples so that there may be no
mistake about what the 'vulgar or
slovenly' use in its simplest form is:
Or can these tickets be kept (1. the sugar
cards were) by the retailer? / The retail
price can never reach a prohibitive figure
1. petrol has done. / The waves of
China's revolution have risen 1. the
waters of the rivers did last year. / They
studied the rules of a game 1. a lawyer
would study an imperfectly-drawn-up
will. I Our great patron saint 'St.
George' was a Greek, 1. a good many
of the saints are. / The idea that you
can learn the technique of an art 1. you
can learn the multiplication table or the
use of logarithms.
In U.S. the colloquial use of /. as a
conjunction has been carried a step
further by treating it as equivalent not
only to as but also to as if, a practice
that still grates on English ears.
Examples from the OED Supp. are
The old fellow drank of the brandy 1. he
was used to it. / None of them act I. they
belonged to the hotel.
2. The rest of this article is intended
for those who decide against the con-
junctional use that has been already
discussed, and wish to avoid also some
similar questionable uses of a less
easily recognizable kind. All the
examples in i were of the undisguised
conjunctional use, and contained a
subordinate clause with its verb ; most
of those now to come have no sub-
ordinate verb, and in all of them /. may
be regarded as an adjective or adverb
having the additional power (cf. worth)
of directly governing nouns as if it
were a preposition.
The first type is perhaps not really
different from that discussed in I.
335 like
Examples are: These lovely shores of
Ullswater will be just sterile shores like
you see at Thirlmere./.Bur in an indus-
trialized county 1. so great a part of
Lancashire is, the architecture can
hardly fail to . . . / He even looks
exactly 1. the member for Stratford-
upon-Avon should. The peculiarity
of these is that in each there is a
previous noun or pronoun, shores,
county, he, with which /. may agree as
an adjective, and an ellipsis of 'those'
or 'what' may be supposed. Such a
defence is neither plausible nor
satisfactory, and the sentences are no
better than others containing a verb.
Of sentences in which /. is not fol-
lowed by a verb, certain forms are
unexceptionable, but are liable to ex-
tensions that are not so. The un-
questioned forms are He talks I. an
expert and You are treating me I. a fool,
in which /. is equivalent to a preposi-
tional adverb = similarly to; and
You, I. me, are disappointed, in which
/. is equivalent either to an adverb as
before, or perhaps rather to a pre-
positional adjective = resembling in
this respect. The second, third, and
fourth types are faulty and represent
neglect of various limitations observed
in the correct forms.
Second type: The Committee was
today, 1. yesterday, composed of the
following gentlemen, j The Turks would
appreciate the change, as, unlike Ko-
weit, their political title is here beyond
dispute. I It is certain that now, unlike
the closing years of last century, quota-
tion from his poetry is singularly rare. /
We may have no, like last year, when
Paignton . . . and Jersey all enjoyed a
sun-bath of nearly 200 hours. The
limitation here disregarded is that the
word governed by /. must be a noun,
not an adverb or an adverbial phrase.
Yesterday and last year are not nouns,
but an adverb and an adverbial phrase ;
and Koweït and the closing years,
meaning at Koweit and in the closing
years, have also only a deceitful ap-
pearance of being nouns.
Third type: People get alarmed on
each occasion on which (1. the present
case) dying children suddenly appear.
like 336
He has completed a new work in which,
1. its author's recent books, no failing
in sparkle or vigour will be traceable. /
And then came the war; 1. many an-
other English village, it filtered slowly,
very slowly, through to his. The
limitation (suggested with diffidence)
that has here been disregarded is that
the preceding noun to which /. is
attached must be not one governed by
a preposition, but subject or object of
the main verb. The preceding nouns
are which (i.e. occasion), which (i.e.
work), and his (i.e. village), governed
by on, in, and to ; instead of /., read as
in the present case, as in its author's
recent books, and as to many another.
Fourth type: L. his Roman prede-
cessor, his private life was profligate;
I. Antony, he was an insatiate gambler. /
Although, 1. his colleague, his conduct
had not been above reproach. The
limitation is that the word governed by
/. must be in pari materia with the one
to which it is compared. The pre-
decessor and his colleague are not so
related to his life and his conduct; but
Antony is to he, and that sentence
alone will pass muster. This mistake,
however, of comparing unlike things,
though the commonest type of misuse
of /. by educated writers, is not pecu-
liar to /., but is a slovenly parsimony
of words that may occur in many other
constructions. It is perhaps even
commoner with unlike than /. : Unlike
Great Britain, the upper house in the
United States is an elected body.
A warning should, however, be
added against going too far in anxiety
to avoid all questionable uses of /.
A fashion seems to be growing, even
among some good writers, to prefer as
to /. not only, rightly, as a conjunction,
but also, iÛ-advisedly, as a preposi-
tional adjective. In Paris he was dis-
suaded from a literary career and, as his
friend and rival Bernard, entered on the
study of medicine. / Lord A, as his fellow
crusaders, B and C, is no pedant. / As
Macaulay before him. Professor Trevor
Roper generally mentions the name of the
book he is reviewing. On another page
of the newspaper from which the last
quotation is taken we may read Like
like
Shaw, Gilbert had the pleasure of be-
coming comfortably rich. If these two
are compared it is clear that /. Shaw is
preferable to as Macaulay, both as more
idiomatic and as an insurance against
ambiguity. Shakespeare did not make
Antony say 'I am no orator 1. Brutus
is', but he felt no qualms about 'It is
excellent to have a giant's strength, but
it is tyrannous to use it 1. a giant'.
Again, the fact that there is a verb
to like, and that one cannot say / very /.,
or / too I., seems to create in the minds
of some would-be purists the idea that
even when /. is not a verb but a pre-
positional adjective very or too must
be helped out by much. The new
measure proved to be very much I. the
original one. j It was too much I.
flogging a dead horse. Polonius did not
say 'Very much 1. a whale', and there
is no more reason for writing too much
I. flogging than there would be for
saying 'You are driving too much near
the car in front of you'.
-like. 'In formations intended as
nonce-words, or not generally current,
the hyphen is ordinarily used'—OED.
For instance the OED prints cowl-like,
eel-like, flail-like, jail-like, owl-like,
and pearl-like. But established -like
compounds are commonly written as
one word—ladylike, lifelike, statesman-
like, etc. See HYPHENS.
like, v. 1 . / would I. Even on those
who use should and would according to
the Englishman's idiom under all or-
dinary temptations the verb /. seems to
exercise an irresistible influence; a
couple of examples follow pro forma,
but anyone can find as many as he
pleases with very little search: We
would I. to ask one or two questions
on our own account. / There is one
paragraph in it that I would I. to refer
to. There is indeed no mystery
about why people do this; it is
because, if the thing had to be said
without the use of the verb like, would
and not should is the form to use : We
would ask; that I would refer to. But
that has nothing to do with what is
right when the verb /. is used. If
anything it makes the matter worse;
likely
would is properly U9ed without
/. because it contains the idea of
volition; to use it with /. is equivalent
to saying / should I. to 1.1 would I. is no
better than any of the wills and woulds
that are well recognized as Scottish,
Irish, American, and other kinds of
English, but not English English. If
the SHALL and WILL idiom is worth
preserving at all (though reasons are
given in that article for fearing that
it is crumbling irretrievably), / should
like must be treated as its proper form.
2 . L. to see and /. seeing are equally
idiomatic, but dislike prefers seeing.
likely, adv. Yet it was not easy to
divine the thought behind that intent-
ness of gaze', likely it was far from the
actual scene apparently holding its
attention. In educated speech and
writing in England the adverb is never
used without very, most, or more, ex-
cept by way of poetic archaism or of
stylistic NOVELTY-HUNTING. But in
Scotland and Ireland it is common in
speech and in U.S. may be found in
print: The climate in America is so
severe in winter that stocks will I. die
out. I It will I. be financed largely by
capital raised in the United States. For
likelily, see -LILY; for likelier adv., -ER
AND -EST 3. See also APT.
likewise. The use as a conjunction
(Its tendency to wobble and its uni-
formity of tone colour, I. its restricted
powers of execution) is, like the similar
use of ALSO, an ILLITERACY; the OED
quotes no example.
-lily. Avoidance of the adverbs in
-lily, i.e. adverbs made regularly from
adjectives in -ly, is merely a matter of
taste, but is very general and increas-
ing. Neither the difficulty of saying
the words nor the sound of them when
said is a serious objection so long as
there are not more than three syllables ;
holily and statelily and lovelily are not
hard to say or harsh to hear; but with
heavenlily and ruffianlily hesitation is
natural; and the result has been that
adverbs in -lily, however short, are now
with a few special exceptions seldom
heard and seldomer seen. Methods of
avoidance are various :
337 - l i l y
1 . It is always possible to use a peri-
phrasis or a synonym, and to say in a
masterly manner, at a timely moment,
and the like, instead of masterlily,
timelily, or to be content with deco-
rously etc. instead of manner lily.
2 . A large number of adjectives in
-ly are established as adverbs also. So
early, (most or very) LIKELY, and the
adjectives of periodical recurrence like
daily and hourly. A single quotation
will show the danger of making one's
own adverbs of this kind: External
evidence, however, is rare; and its rarity
gives value to such work as Mr.
here masterly does.
3. Before adjectives and adverbs the
-ly adjective often stands instead of
the -lily adverb, making a kind of in-
formal compound. Though we should
say horribly pale and not horrible pale,
we allow ourselves ghastly pale rather
than use ghastlily; so heavenly bright,
beastly cold, jolly soon, etc.—all with-
out the hyphen that would mark regu-
lar compounds.
4. In sentences where it is just pos-
sible, though not natural, for a pre-
dicative adjective to stand instead of
an adverb, that way is sometimes taken
with an adjective in -ly though it
would not be taken with another: it
happened timely enough, though not
opportune enough; she nodded friendly,
though not she nodded amiable.
5. Perhaps any adjective formed by
appending -ly either to an adjective
(kind,'kindly ; dead, deadly) or to a noun
of the kind that is easily used in apposi-
tion like an adjectival epithet (cowardly,
cf. the coward king; soldierly, cf. a soldier
colonist ; scholarly, cf. the scholar gipsy) is
sometimes, though always consciously
and noticeably, allowed to pass as an
adverb : it was ruffianly done, soldierly
conducted, scholarly expounded.
On the other hand, avoidance is not
always called for; some -lily words
are current, though not many. Those
that might suggest themselves (he
laughed jollily; sillily complacent; live
holily; dodged it zvilily) seem to be all
from adjectives in which the / is part
of the word-stem, not of ly as an
adjectival ending; and though we are
limb 338
most of us not conscious of that fact
nowadays, it may have had its effect
in separating these from the others.
l i m b . When we first come across an
eclipse in the newspapers and read of
the sun's lower /., we suspect the writer
of making jokes or waxing poetical, so
odd is the association of limbs with
that globular form. It is a relief to
learn that /. cannot be used for edge
without the help of a metaphor; the
/. in astronomy etc. is from Latin
limbus hem, and the /. of ordinary
speech is a separate and native word.
lime the mineral makes limy, the fruit
limey; see -EY AND -Y. Limey as U.S.
slang for an Englishman, especially a
sailor, originated in the compulsory
use of lime juice as an anti-scorbutic in
the British Navy.
limit, delimit. These verbs should
not be used as synonyms. To limit is
to confine within bounds; to delimit
(or delimitate) is to determine pre-
cisely what those bounds are, e.g. of a
territorial frontier.
limited is a victim of SLIPSHOD EX-
TENSION. Legitimate uses such as The
time for discussion of this motion is !. /
Only a I. amount of money can be
devoted to this project have led to a lazy
habit of treating /. as a convenient
synonym for many more suitable and
more exact words. These houses are
intended for people of I. means (small). /
He has I. interests outside his work

is I. (meagre). / The occasions on which
such drastic measures are likely to be

For a time, it became a VOGUE WORD
(often facetious) for getting rid of or
doing away with anything by any
means, especially obstacles to the
liquidator's ambitions. But the fresh-
ness that made it attractive seems now
to be wearing off. That liquidate is
always used figuratively is no doubt
the reason for coining liquidize for the
literal sense. But seeing that liquefy has
been available to us for 500 years we
ought to be able to do without the pis
aller of an

nexus 391
the convenient next best idiom. That
idiom requires a superlative, and such
words as oldest, worst, narrowest,
weightiest suit it well; but it is ugly
with adjectives haying no superlative
other than that with most, and there
is a temptation to try whether, for
instance, next important will not pass
for next most important. It should be
resisted; the natural sense of the two
next important institutions is 'the two
next institutions that are of impor-
tance', which need by no means be the
two that are next in importance.
nexus. The English plural nexuses
is intolerably sibilant, and the Latin,
nexus {-us), not nexi (see -us), sounds
pedantic; the plural is consequently
very rare ; if one must be used -uses is
recommended. See LATIN PLURALS.

quialism, but should be confined, in

3. Meaning. 'I am sure', cried
Catherine, ' I did not mean to say
anything wrong; but it is a nice book,
and why should I not call it so?'
'Very true,' said Henry, 'and this is
a very nice day, and we are taking
a very nice walk; and you are two very
nice young ladies. Oh! it is a very nice
word indeed! it does for everything'
(Northanger Abbey). N. has been spoilt,
like CLEVER, by its bonnes fortunes; it
has been too great a favourite with the
ladies, who have charmed out of it all
its individuality and converted it into
a mere diffuser of vague and mild
agreeableness. That was not how the
Duke of Wellington used it when he
described the battle of Waterloo as
'a damned nice thing—the nearest run
thing you ever saw in your life'.
Everyone who gives it its more proper
senses which fill most of the space
given to it in any dictionary, and
avoids the one that tends to oust them
all, does a real if small service to the
language.
no
nigger. To be called a n. is now
regarded as an insult by an American
negro, unless the word is used affec-
tionately by one negro of another;
a murder provoked by the words 'You
dirty nigger' is a leading case in U.S.
criminal law (Fisher v. U.S.). N. has
been described as 'the term that
carries with it all the obloquy and
contempt and rejection which whites
have inflicted on blacks'. But it
survives in the phrases Work like a «.,
The n. in the woodpile, n. minstrels.
-n-, -nn-. Monosyllables ending in n
double it before suffixes beginning
with vowels if the sound preceding the
n is a short vowel but not if it is a long
one or a vowel and r: mannish, but
darning; fenny, but keener; winning,
but reined; conned, but coined; runner,
but turned. Words of more than one
syllable follow the rule for mono-
syllables if their last syllable is ac-
cented, but otherwise do not double
the n: japanned and beginner, but
dragooned,womanish, turbaned, awaken-
ing, muslined.
no. 1. Parts of speech. 2 . Confusion
of adjective and adverb. 3. No in
negative confusions. 4 . Negative
parentheses. 5. Writing of com-
pounds. 6. Plural.
1. No is (A) an adjective meaning in
the singular not a (or not any), and in
the plural not any; it is a shortened
form of none, which is still used as its
pronoun form: No German applied;
No Germans applied; None of the
applicants was, or were, German. No
is (B) an adverb meaning by no amount
and used only with comparatives : / am
glad it is no worse. No is (C) an adverb
meaning not and used only after or,
and chiefly in the phrase whether or
no: Pleasant or no, it is true; He must
do it whether he will or no. No is (D)
a particle representing a negative sen-
tence of which the contents are clear
from a preceding question or from the
context: Is he there?—No (i.e. he is
not there). No, it is too bad(i.t. I shall
not submit; it is too bad). No is (E)
a noun meaning the word no, a denial
or refusal, a negative vote or voter:
no 392
Don't say no; She will not take a no;
The Noes have it.
2 . Confusion of adjective and adverb.
If the tabulation in (1) is correct, it is
clear how the worse than superfluous
a, the, and her, made their way into
the following extracts. The writer of
each thought his no was a (B) or a (C)
adverb (against which the absence of
the invariable accompaniments should
have warned him) and did not see that
it was the adjective, which contains
a in itself and is therefore incompatible

hardly give the book higher praise than
to say of it that it is a no unworthy
companion of Moberly's 'Atonement'

cant value of $54,000,000 (the not). /

excusable because the conditions are

discontent than a second volume of this

a sentence as The second volume zuill
be no more cheerful a by-product than
the first would be right, no being there
actually the adverb. But the phrase
in its present setting means no by-
product that shall be more cheerful,
and no is the adjective and contains
a and refuses to have another thrust
upon it. For no mean city etc. see MEAN.
3. No, used in the first of two parallel
clauses, ensnares many a brave un-
wary writer; the modifications neces-
sary for the second clause are forgotten,
and bad grammar or bad sense results.
See NEGATIVE MISHANDLING; some
specimens are: He sees in England no
attempt to mould history according to
academic plans, but to direct it from

rather directed). / Although no party

of importance . . . now have;.
4 . Negative parentheses. The rule
here to be insisted on concerns nega-
tive expressions in general, and is
stated under no only because that word
happens to be present in violations of
it oftener perhaps than any other. The
rule is that adverbial qualifications
containing a negative must not be
comma'd off from the words they
belong to as though they were mere
parentheses. The rule only needs
stating to be accepted; but the habit
of providing adverbial phrases with
commas often gets the better of com-
mon sense. It is clear, however, that
there is the same essential absurdity in
writing He will, under no circumstances,
consent as in writing He will, never,
consent, or He will, not, consent. It is
worth while to add, for the reader's
consideration while he glances at the
examples, that it would often be better
in these negative adverbial phrases to
resolve no into not. . . any etc. We are
assured that the Prime Minister will, in
no circumstances and on no consideration
whatever, consent (will not in any . . .
or on any . . . Or omit the commas,
at the least). / And Paley and Butler,

circumstances lead).
5. Writing of compounds. About no
ball (noun) and no-ball (verb), nobody,
and nohow, doubts are needless; the
forms given are the right ones. For
no one see EVERY ONE, I , where that
form is recommended. The adverbs
noways and nowise are best so written;
but in nowise, which is often used
instead of the correct in no wise, is as
absurd as by nomeans or on no-account
would be; cf. ANY I .

nomad. The pronunciation nom- is
gaining on nom- especially in the noun,
though the COD still puts nom- first.
nom de guerre, nom de plume,
pen name, pseudonym. Nom de
guerre is current French, but, owing to
the English currency of nom de plume,
is far from universally intelligible to
Englishmen, most of whom assume
that, whatever else it may mean, it can
surely not mean nom de plume. Nom
de plume is open to the criticism that
it is ridiculous for English writers to
use a French phrase that does not come
from France; not perhaps as ridiculous
as the critics think (see MORALE), but
fear of them will at any rate deter some
of us. Nobody perhaps uses pen-name
without feeling either 'What a good
boy am I to abstain from showing off
my French and translate nom de plume
into honest English!', or else 'I am not
as those publicans who suppose there
is such a phrase as nom de plume'. For
everyone is instinctively aware that
pen-name, however native or natural-
ized its elements, is no English-bred
word, but a translation of nom de
plume. Pseudonym, lastly, is a queer
out-of-the-way term for an everyday
thing. But it is perhaps the best of the
bunch except for those who take the
comrnonsense view of nom de plume—
that it is the established word for the
thing, and its antecedents do not con-
cern us. It is now sometimes used for
pseudonyms in general, not merely
those adopted by writers ; and it would
be unreasonable to take exception to
its being granted a liberty already won
by nom de guerre.
nomenclature. Pronunciation no'-
menklâture or nomenclature; most
dictionaries prefer the former.
Dictionaries that give a list of
synonyms with each word may be very
helpful to a writer if they cast their
nets wide and are used with discrimi-
nation (see SYNONYMS). Otherwise they
may do him a very doubtful service.
One can hardly believe but that the
authors of the extracts below have
looked up name in search of some
longer and more imposing word, some
non-
(shall we say?) adequately grandiose
vocable. That nomenclature does not
mean a name, but a system of naming
or of names, is to such writers what
they would perhaps call a mere meticu-
losity; see LOVE OF THE LONG WORD.

establishment was the well-known Glou-
cester Coffee House, the nomenclature
of which was derived from that Duke

mittee of City men has just launched

nominal. For this as the adjective
of noun, see NOUN.
nominative. The grammatical word
is always pronounced nô'mïnâtïv, often
slurred into nom'nàtiv (cf. rej'ment for
REGIMENT); the adjective connected in
sense with nominate and nomination
(e.g. in partly elective and partly n.) is
often, and perhaps more conveniently,
nomind'tiv.
nominativus pendens. A form of
ANACOLUTHON in which a sentence is
begun with what appears to be the
subject, but before the verb is reached
something else is substituted in word
or in thought, and the supposed sub-
ject is left in the air. The most familiar
and violent instance is which used in
Sarah Gamp's manner {which fiddle-
strings is weakness to expredge my nerves
this night); but the irregularity is not
uncommon even in writing, and is
always apt to occur in speech. Cf., in
Shakespeare, 'They who brought me
in my master's hate, I live to look upon
their tragedy' (Rich. Ill, in. ii. 57).
non-. This negative prefix, says the
COD, 'is now freely used'. Its use is
indeed becoming too free. It has given
us many useful words of the type of
non-attendance, non-combatant, non-
conformist, non-skid, and non-stop, and
some useful differentiations by pro-
viding a colourless antonym where the
nonce
ordinary one has acquired a positive
implication, e.g. non-effective and in-
effective) non-human and inhuman, non-
moral and immoral) non-natural and
unnatural, non-professional and un-
professional. But the ease with which
any word can be negatived by this
device tempts the indolent to use
it unnecessarily and to write for
instance non-concur for dissent, non-
essential for unessential, non-sick for
healthy, non-success for failure. Cf. the
similar abuse of DE- and DIS-.
nonce survives only in the phrases for
the nonce (and that with a WARDOUR
STREET flavour) and nonce word, mean-

none. I . It is a mistake to suppose that
the pronoun is singular only and must
at all costs be followed by singular
verbs etc.; the OED explicitly states
that plural construction is commoner.
2 . The forms none so, none too, are
idiomatic (It is none so pleasant to learn
that you have only six months to live',
The look he gave me was none too
amiable), but are perhaps seldom used
(especially the former) without a cer-
tain sense of condescending to the
vernacular as an aid to heartiness of
manner or to emphasis; and con-
descension is always repellent.
nonentity, in the now rare abstract
sense of non-existence, should have
the non pronounced clearly non, and
perhaps be written with a hyphen
(non-entity). In the current concrete
sense of a person of no account, it is
written nonentity and said with the o
obscured.

recommended; see EVERY ONE I .
nonsense. The Government cannot give
way to the railwaymen without making
a complete nonsense of its restraint policy.
The idiom is make nonsense (or make
sense) of something, without the in-
definite article.
nor is a word that should come into
our minds as we repeat the General
Confession. Most of us in our time
have left undone those things which
we ought to have done (i.e. failed to
put in nor when it was wanted) and
done those things which we ought not
to have done (i.e. thrust it in when
there was no room for it). The nega-
tive forms of He moves and speaks, He
both moves and speaks, are He moves
not nor speaks, He neither moves nor
speaks', or, with the verb resolved as is
usual in modern negative sentences,
He does not move or speak, He does not
either move or speak. The tendency to
go wrong is probably due to confusion
between the simple verbs (moves etc.)
and the resolved ones (does move etc.);
if the verb is resolved, there is often
an auxiliary that serves both clauses,
and, as the negative is attached to
the auxiliary, its force is carried on
together with that of the auxiliary
and no fresh negative is wanted. Two
cautions are necessary on this carrying
on of the negative force and consequent
preference of or to nor. The first is that
it will not do to repeat the auxiliary
and yet use or under the impression
that the previous negative suffices;
that is what has been done in:
He was naturally and properly at
pains to prove that his company had
not acted negligently or carelessly or
had been unduly influenced by reasons
of economy (There was a choice here
between or been and and had not been',
or had been makes nonsense").
The other caution, much more often
required, is that if the negative is
nor 395
attached not to an auxiliary (or other
word common to two clauses) that
will carry it forward, but to some
other part of the first clause, the nega-
tiye force is cut off and has to be
started afresh by nor. The following
examples illustrate the danger; in
each or must be corrected to nor if
the rest of the sentence is to remain
as it is, though some slight change of
arrangement such as is indicated would
make or possible : In this kind of work
there was often little oral preparation
of material, little systematic collection
of facts and views, well assimilated and
digested, or much discussion of balance
and proportion. The writer has for-
gotten that he began there was often
little and has ended as though he had
said there was seldom much. Or must
be corrected to nor was there. / In its
six months of power it has offered not
one constructive measure or done
a single thing to relieve suffering (it has
not offered one). / He did nothing with-
out consulting Lovel, or failed in any-
thing without expecting and fearing his
admonishing (he did not do anything
. . . or fail).
The above are the ordinary types of
mistake with nor. Others that should
hardly require mention are either . . .
nor and the poetical omission of
the first negative. Either . . . nor is
as bad as NEITHER . . . or: There was
not, either in 1796 in Italy, nor on the
Mediterranean coast of Spain in 1808,
any British force at work which . . . /
As we have not got the world's tonnage
production for April, nor yet either the
British nor the world's losses for the
same month, it is only possible to . . .
The insertion of a clumsy and where
nor should stand by itself is shown in :
Mr. Burton never underestimates Othel-
lo, and nor in consequence do we. / The
secret encouragement to Kruger from the
Germans in 1899 is no part of school
history, and nor is Kruger's obstinate
withholding of civic rights from the
English burghers.
Do nor undo is legitimate in poetry,
but not in prose of so ordinary a kind
as : For her fingers had been so numbed
that she could do nor undo anything.
not
normalcy (= normality) is a word of
the 'spurious hybrid' class (see HYBRIDS
AND MALFORMATIONS), and seems to
have nothing to recommend it. It is
said by the OED to be originally U.S.,
but there is no ground for the charge
made against President Harding of
having coined it; others had used it
long before he did.
northerly. For the special uses and
meanings of this set of words, see
EASTERLY.
nostalgi(a)(c) is formed by com-
pounding two Greek words so as to
give the meaning of suffering caused
by an unfulfilled wish to return home;
it was invented as a medical name for
homesickness so severe as to amount
to a disease. It would be unreasonable
to condemn, on etymological grounds,
its now common use to describe the
wistful melancholy that comes from
thinking not of the home that cannot
be revisited but of the years that can-
not be relived. But its popularity
seems to be putting it in danger of less
venial extensions which would deprive
it of its essential ingredient of pain or
suffering. The point where Sussex,
Kent, and Surrey meet—one of the

1. Not all and all. . . not. All is not
gold that glisters; Every land does not

rewrite these sentences as Not all is
gold that glisters (or Not all that glisters
is gold) and Not every land produces
everything. The negative belongs logi-
cally to all and every, not to the verbs,
and the strict sense of the first proverb
would be that glistering proves a sub-
stance to be not gold. A valued corre-
spondent has written—'Do not you
think that the use of all . . . not ought
not 396 not
to be restricted to propositions of the
type All A is not-B, and where Not
all A is B is meant, that should be the
order? Of course that never has been
a rule, from "All of you have not the
knowledge of God" onwards, but it
would save a great deal of ambiguity
if it could be made one. I notice that
Somerville and Byrne, in their Ger-
man Grammar, with Nicht allé

is that he should live long enough.

ties and ambiguities. All . . . not for

denounced by those who have time to
spend on niceties; but it is still, like
many other illogicalities, the natural
and idiomatic English. It may pass
away in time, for magna est veritas et
praevalebit; in the meantime it is worth
anyone's while to get on speaking
terms with the new exactitudes (i.e.
to write Not all himself), but worth
nobody's while to fall foul of those
who do not choose to abandon the
comfortable old slovenries.
2. Not in MEiosis and PERIPHRASIS.
'We say well and elegantly, not un-
grateful, for very grateful'—OED
quotation dated 1671. It was a favour-
ite figure of Milton's: Eve was 'not
unamazed' at finding that a snake
could speak, and Comus's well-placed
words were baited with 'reasons not
implausible'. It is by this time a faded
or jaded elegance, this replacing of a
term by the negation of its opposite;
jaded by general over-use; faded by
the blight of WORN-OUT HUMOUR with
its not a hundred miles from, not uncon-
nected with, not unmindful of, and other
once fresh young phrases. ('One can
cure oneself of the not un- formation',
said Orwell, 'by memorizing this sen-
tence: A not unblack dog was chasing
a not unsmall rabbit across a not un~
green field.') But the very popularity of
the idiom in English is proof enough
that there is something in it congenial
to the English temperament, and it is
pleasant to believe that it owes its
success with us to a stubborn national
dislike of putting things too strongly.
It is clear too that there are contexts
to which, for example, not inconsider-
able is more suitable than considerable',
by using it we seem to anticipate and
put aside, instead of not foreseeing or
ignoring, the possible suggestion that
so-and-so is inconsiderable. The right
principle is to acknowledge that the
idiom is allowable, and then to avoid it
except when it is more than allowable.
Examples occur in every day's news-
papers, in which their authors would
hardly claim that elegance or point
was gained by the double negative,
and would admit that they used it only
because they saw no reason why they
should not; such are: The style of
argument suitable for the election
contest is, no doubt, not infrequently
different from the style of argument
suitable for use at Westminster (often).
One may imagine that Mr. will
not be altogether unrelieved when his
brother actor returns tomorrow (will be
much relieved).
3. Not in exclamations. But if you
look at the story of that quadrilateral
of land, what a complex of change and
diversity do you not discover! A jumble
of question and exclamation. The
right exclamation would be: What
a complex you discover ! The possible
question would be: What complexity
do you not discover? What a complex,
and the stop, are essentially exclama-
tory: not is essentially interrogative;
do is characteristically interrogative,
but not impossible in exclamations.
The forms in a simpler sentence are:
Exclamation: What I have suffered!;
Question: What have I not suffered?;
Exclamation with inversion: What
have I suffered!', Confusion: What
not 397 not
have I not suffered! See STOPS (ques-
tion and exclamation marks).
4 . Not pleonastic. The point dis-
cussed in (3) was the intrusion of
a not, unnecessary indeed but explic-
able, into exclamations that are con-
fused with rhetorical questions. Much
less excusable, as needing no analysis
to show that it is wrong and often
destructive of the sense, is the not that
is evoked in a subordinate clause as
a mere unmeaning echo of an actual
or virtual negative in the main sen-
tence, as in The Home Secretary said
he had found nothing to make him
doubt that H. was not rightly convicted.
We all know people who habitually
say / shouldn't wonder if it didn't
turn to snow soon when they mean if it
turned. But the same mistake in print
is almost as common as it is absurd—
so common indeed with wonder and
SURPRISE as to rank as a STURDY
INDEFENSIBLE. Nobody can predict with
confidence how much time may not be
employed on the concluding stages of the
Bill. I I do not of course deny that in
this, as in all moral principles, there
may not be found, here and there,
exceptional cases. / He is unable to say
how much of the portraiture of Christ
may not be due to the idealization of
His life and character. / It would not
be at all surprising if, by attempting too
much, Mr. has not to some extent
defeated his own object.
5. Not . . . but. Mrs. Fraser's book,
however, is not confined to filling up the
gaps in Livingstone's life . . . but it deals
most interestingly with her father's own
early adventures. . . . See BUT 3 for
more flagrant mishandlings of not
followed by but. The difference
between right and wrong often
depends on the writer's seeing that
the subject, for instance, of the not
sentence must not be repeated (or
taken up by a pronoun) in the but
sentence; it must be allowed to carry
on silently. The above double sentence,
which is not idiomatic English as it
stands, is at once cured by the omis-
sion of it.
6. Not only out of its place is like
a tintack loose on the floor; it might
have been most serviceable somewhere
else, and is capable of giving acute and
undeserved pain where it is. To read
the following extracts one after
another, all of them requiring only
a preference for order over chaos to
have tidied them up, must surely call
a blush to the Englishman's cheek for
his fellow countrymen's slovenly
ways : Ireland, unlike the other Western
nations, preserved n. o. its pre-
Christian literature, but when Chris-
tianity came, not direct from Rome but
from Britain and Gaul, that literature
received a fresh impulse from the new
faith (N. o. did Ireland . . . preserve). /
We must remember that n. 0. are we
concerned in the present situation be-
cause South Africa is a member of the
Commonwealth but because of our
Protectorates (We are concerned in
the present situation n.o. because...)./
N. 0. had she now a right to speak, but
to speak with authority (She had now
a right n. o. to speak). / N. o. does the
proportion of suicides vary with the
season of the year, but with different
races (The proportion of suicides
varies n. o. with). / N. o. would this
scheme help the poorer districts over
their financial difficulties, but would
remove from London the disgrace that
in some parts of London the streets are
. . . (This scheme would n. o. help). /
N. o. was the audience drawn from
central London; those privileged to hear
the speech came from all parts (The
audience was not drawn from central
London only. The blunder is here
double, and before this tintack can be
harmless it must be not merely picked
up, but smashed up).
7. For not because as a cause of
ambiguity {Mr. Dayal said he was not
returning to New York because of the
outbreak of fighting with the Congolese)
see BECAUSE 2 .
8. Not that etc. Not that, not but
what, not so beginning a sentence
(sometimes VERBLESS) to introduce
a modification, clarification, or con-
trast, is established idiom. The out-
standing fact about Mrs. Gaskell is her
femininity. Not that Charlotte Brontë
and George Eliot are unfeminine. / Not
nothing less than 398 noun-adjectives
but what the accident may have been of
Herbert's making. J Most men novelists
cannot resist it. Not so Trollope.
nothing less than. The OED re-
marks: 'The combination nothing less
than has two quite contrary senses',
and gives as the first 'quite equal to,
the same thing as', with, for illustra-
tion, But yet methinks my father's
execution Was nothing less than bloody
tyranny, and as the second 'far from
being, any thing rather than', with,
for illustration, Who, trusting to the
laws, expected n. 1 . 1 . an attack. To the
second sense it adds the description
'Now rare'. As a matter of grammar,
either sense is legitimate, less being
different parts of speech in the two, as
appears in the light of paraphrases:
my father's death was no smaller thing
than tyranny (i.e. less is an adjective);
they expected nothing in a lower degree
than they expected an attack (i.e. less
is an adverb); grammar, then, leaves
the matter open. But the risks of
ambiguity are very great. If the sense
of they expected n. I. t. an attack did
not happen to be fixed by trusting to
the laws, who would dare decide
whether they expected it very much
or very little? The sense called by the
OED 'now rare' should, in the in-
terests of plain expression, be made
rarer by total abandonment; a speaker
can show what he means by n. I. t.
by the way he says it, but a writer
cannot. It is unfortunately less rare
than the label would lead one to
suppose; passages like the two that
follow are not uncommon, and are
very puzzling to the reader: It recog-
nizes also both the necessity of reform
and liberation from dead dogmas and
rubrics, and the impossibility of reform
coming from a House of Commons
desiring n. 1. t. to occupy its debates
with discussions of the validity of the
thirty-nine articles. / Now we are intro-
duced to inspired 'crowd-men' or heroes
who have a passion for making order
out of the human chaos and finding
expression for the real soul of the people;
these heroes or crowd-men resemble n. 1.
t. the demagogue as popularly conceived.
nought. See NAUGHT.
noun has two adjectives—nominal and
nounal, but is comfortable with neither.
The objection to the first is that it is
a word much used in other senses.
This has induced grammarians to form
the word from which they of all people
should have shrunk—nounal. It is
what is described in the article HY-
BRIDS AND MALFORMATIONS as a Spurious
hybrid; see that article for a discussion
of similar words. The grammarian's
right course is to work with the word
noun as far as possible, and, when an
adjectival form or an adverb is indis-
pensable, use nominally). See also
ADJECTIVAL.
noun-adjectives. 'Too many ofs have
dropped out of the language', said Lord
Dunsany in 1943, 'and the dark of the
floor is littered with this useful word.'
Some twenty years earlier this pheno-
menon had provoked the following
comment in the first edition of the
present dictionary: 'It will be a sur-
prise, and to some an agreeable one,
if at this late stage in our change from
an inflexional to an analytic language
we revert to a free use of the case that
we formerly tended more and more to
restrict. It begins to seem likely that
drink's victims will before long be the
natural and no longer the affected or
rhetorical version of the victims of
drink. The devotees of inflexion may
do well to rejoice; the change may
improve rather than injure the lan-
guage ; and if that is so let due praise
be bestowed on the newspaper press,
which is bringing it about. But to the
present (or perhaps already past)
generation, which has been instinc-
tively aware of differences between
drink's victims and the victims of drink,
and now finds them scornfully dis-
regarded, there will be an unhappy
interim. It is the headline that is
doing it.'
The last sentence was prophetic. The
headline has gone on doing it. The
principal destroyer of ofs is no longer
the possessive case, though it still
claims its victims : recent examples are
They assume the rumour's truth, j The
noun and adjective accent
scene of the story's most thrilling com-
plications, I In Johnson's despite, / The
two shoes' disparity. But as chief cul-
prit it has been supplanted by the
noun-adjective. There is of course
nothing new in putting a noun to this
use when no convenient adjective is
available; examples abound in every-
day speech—government department,
nursery school, television set, test match,
and innumerable others. But the noun-
adjective, useful in its proper place,
is now running riot and corrupting
the language in two ways. It is
throwing serviceable adjectives onto
the scrap heap; why, for instance,
should we speak of an enemy attack,
a luxury hotel, a novelty number, an
England eleven, when we have the
adjectives hostile, luxurious, novel, and
English} And, what is worse, it is
making us forget that to link two words
together with of may be both clearer
and more graceful than to put the
second before the first as an attribute:
to forget for instance that, though
nursery school is a legitimate use of the
noun-adjective, nursery school provi-
sion is an ugly and obscure way of
saying provision of nursery schools',
that if a large vehicle fleet were trans-
lated into either a large fleet of vehicles
or a fleet of large vehicles an ambiguity
would be removed, and that a girl who
could not allay her guilt feelings would
probably find her guilty feelings (or her
feelings of guilt) no less persistent. It

old phrase state of the world', today it

noun and adjective accent. When
a word of more than one syllable is in
use both as a noun and as an adjective,
there is a certain tendency to differen-
tiate the sound by accenting the last
syllable in the adjective, but not in the
noun. Thus There is a co'mpact be-
tween us, but His style is compa'ct. The
tendency is much less marked than the
corresponding one with nouns and
verbs (see next article) and seems to be

weakening. A few examples are given,
of which the first two are, like compact,
undisputed, and the rest questionable;
from these the reader will be able to
form an opinion for application to
similar cases: insti'nct a., i'nstinct n.;
minu'te a., mi'nute n.; conte'nt a.,

noun and verb accent, pronuncia-
tion, and spelling. When there is
both noun and verb work to be done
by a word, and the plan of forming
a noun from the verb, or a verb from
the noun, by adding a formative suffix
(as in stealth from steal) is not followed,
the one word may be called on to double
the parts. In that case there is a strong
tendency to differentiate by pronun-
ciation, as in use (n. ûs, v. ûz); such a
distinction is sometimes, as in use, un-
recorded in spelling, but sometimes
recorded as in calf and calve. It is not
possible to draw up a complete list of

sand-blind 535 satire
sand-blind is neither (like, say, pur-
blind) a current word, nor (like, say,
bat-blind) intelligible at sight. Its mod-
ern existence depends on one passage
(Af. of V. II. ii. 35-80), and it can rank
only as an ARCHAISM. The latest quota-
tion in the OED is dated 1905, But
there is a sort of sand-blindness endemic
in the Liberal party just now. Sand is
now generally taken to be a corruption
of OE 5am = half. If so, the appear-
ance of the word misled both Shake-
speare ( This is my true-begotten father,
who, being more than sand-blind, high
gravel blind, knows me not) and Dr.
Johnson, whose definition is Having a
defect in the eyes by which small par-
ticles appear to fly before them.

the admission that optimism and opti-

convenience over sanguineness and san-

sanhedrim . . . has always been in Eng-
land (from the 17th c.) the only form

sapid, unlike its negative insipid, is
a merely LITERARY WORD.
sapient. Except in the expression
homo sapiens is chiefly a LITERARY
WORD, and usually ironical, e.g. M.
Arnold's doctor who shakes his s. head
and gives the ill he cannot cure a name,
and T. S. Eliot's sapient sutlers of the
Lord.
saponaceous, apart from its use in

sapor, apart from its use in medicine,
is a merely LITERARY WORD; for the

sarcasm does not necessarily involve
irony, and irony has often no touch of
sarcasm. But irony, or the use of ex-
pressions conveying different things
according as they are interpreted, is
so often made the vehicle of s., or the
utterance of things designed to hurt
the feelings, that in popular use the
two are much confused. The essence
of s. is the intention of giving pain by
(ironical or other) bitter words. See
also IRONY, and HUMOUR.
sardine (stone; Rev. iv. 3). Pronounce
sar'dïn. It is probably an error for
sardius, a variety of cornelian, which is

states, earth s., s. towns. Primarily it
means (from Lat. satelles) a member
of a body-guard of an important per-
sonage, often with an implication of
subservience; it is therefore applied
with singular aptness to the s. states
of the Soviet Union. Its use for a
secondary body revolving round a
planet is nearly as old. Its adjectival
use for towns built to absorb some of
the population and industries of over-
crowded cities is recent; it reflects the
idea of 'hangers-on' implicit in the
original meaning and is a legitimate
extension.
satiety. Pronounce sâtï'ëtï.
satire. For rough distinction from
some near-synonyms, see HUMOUR.
Here it may be added that s. has
recently been suffering VULGARIZATION .
A word that suggests the powers of an
Aristophanes, a Juvenal, or a Swift,
and an impulse of saeva indignatio is
prostituted when it is applied to mere
snook-cockers of whom it has been said
satiric(al) 536 save
by one critic, jealous for the integrity
of the word, that their only concern is
to 'find someone who is doing some-
thing—no matter who, no matter what
—and fling a few insults at him', and by
another that their conception of
satire is 'a cannibal dance round the
idea of authority'.
satiric(al). The senses addicted to,
intending, good at, marked by, satire
are peculiar to the long form (a -al
rogue; you are pleased to be -al; with
-al comments; a -al glance). In the
merely classifying sense of or belong-
ing to satire {the poems of Pope;
the Latin writers), either form
may be used, but -ic is commoner.
This DIFFERENTIATION might well be
hastened by deliberate support; but
the line of demarcation between the
two groups is not always clear. See
-IC(AL).
satiric, satyric. The two spellings
represent two different and uncon-
nected words; satyric, which is in
learned or literary use only, means
of satyrs, and especially, in s. drama,
a form of Greek play having a satyr
chorus.
satisfy. There is ample authority,
going back several centuries, for the
use of s. in the sense of 'to furnish with
sufficient proof or information; to set
free from doubt or uncertainty' (OED).
But this meaning sometimes clashes
with that of to please or content; the
fact of which one is satisfied in one
sense may be far from satisfactory in
the other. For this reason it is un-
fortunate that, especially in official
pronouncements, the word convinced
seems to be forgotten, and satisfied is
becoming the standard way of an-
nouncing factual conclusions. Perhaps
its extra syllable seems to give it a more
authoritative air. An announcement of
the type in which convinced would have
been more suitable is The rescue party,
on returning to the surface, said they
were satisfied that there was no possi-
bility of any more of the men being found
alive.
Saturnalia. See LATIN PLURALS 3.
The word is originally plural, but,
being the name of a festival, comes to
be construed, both in literal and meta-
phorical use, more often as singular
(the S. was, or were, at hand; now
follows a s. of crime). When a real
plural is required (the sack of Magde-
burg, the French Revolution, and other
such s. of slaughter), the form is -ia
not -ias.
satyr. See FAUN for distinctions.
save (except). 1. For s. and except,
see PLEONASM 2 . 2 . Trench (English
Synonyms, 4th éd., 1858), writing on
'except, excepting, but, save', has no
more to say of the last than that
' "Save" is almost exclusively limited
to poetry'. He would have a surprise
if he were to see a modern newspaper;
we can still say that it ought to be al-
most limited to poetry, but no longer
that it is. Though nearly everyone uses
except or but, not s., in speaking, and
perhaps everyone in thinking, and
though the natural or 'dominant' word
except is neither undignified nor in-
ferior in clearness, some people seem
to have made up their minds that it is
not good enough for print, and very
mistakenly prefer to translate it, ir-
respective of context, into s, making
s. a FORMAL WORD, like the police-
man's proceed for go. No doubt it
is natural to fall back on s. to avoid
a jingle such as Permission will not be
granted except in very exceptional cir-
cumstances. But does anyone not a
writer—and does any good writer—
think that the substitution of the
formal s. for the natural except in the
following sentences (or but in the first
of them) has improved them? The
handful of ship's officers could do nothing
s. summon the aid of a detachment of the
Civic Guard. / The spur proved to be so
admirably adapted to its purpose that
it has existed unaltered, s. in detail, to
the present day. / So completely sur-
rounded by other buildings as to be
absolutely invisible—s. from a balloon
or an aeroplane. / The baby takes no
special harm, s. that it is allowed to do

save, v. S. the mark (with variants
God s., bless, God bless, the mark) is a
stylistic toy, of which no one can be
said to know the original meaning,
though different people make different
guesses at it. The OED's description
of it, as it now survives, is : 'In modern
literary use (after some of the examples
in Shakespeare), an expression of im-
patient scorn appended to a quoted
expression or to a statement of fact.'

Saxonism and anti-Saxonism.
Saxonism is a name for the attempt
to raise the proportion borne by the
originally and etymologically English
words in our speech to those that come
from alien sources. The Saxonist forms
new derivatives from English words to
displace established words of similar
meaning but Latin descent; revives
obsolete or archaic English words for
the same purpose; allows the genea-
logy of words to decide for him which
is the better of two synonyms. Exam-
ples of the first kind are FOREWORD
(earliest OED quotation, 1842) for
preface, and birdlore (1830) for ornitho-
logy, and BODEFUL (1813) for ominous;
of the second, BETTERMENT for im-
provement, HAPPENINGS for events,
english for translate (into English),
FOLK for people, and FOREBEAR for
ancestor; of the third, BELITTLE for
depreciate, burgess or burgher for
citizen. The wisdom of this
nationalism in language—at least in so
thoroughly composite a language as
English—is very questionable. We
may well doubt whether it benefits the
language; that it does not benefit the
style of the individual, who may or
may not be prepared to sacrifice him-
self for the public good, is pretty clear.
Here is the opinion of the Dictionary
of National Biography on Freeman's
English: 'His desire to use so far as
possible only words which are purely
English limited his vocabulary and
was some drawback to his sentences.'
say
The truth is perhaps that conscious
deliberate Saxonism is folly, that the
choice or rejection of particular words
should depend not on their descent
but on considerations of expressive-
ness, intelligibility, brevity, euphony,
or ease of handling; at the same time
any writer who becomes aware that the
Saxon or native English element in
what he writes is small will do well
to take the fact as a danger-signal.
But the way to act on that signal is
not to translate his Romance words
into Saxon ones ; it is to avoid abstract
and roundabout and bookish phrasing
whenever the nature of the thing to be
said does not require it.
Anti-Saxonism is not, like Saxonism,
a creed. There are indeed, properly
speaking, no anti-Saxonists. The term
is here used as a name for the frame of
mind that turns away not so much
from the etymologically English voca-
bulary as from the homely or the
simple or the clear. It is a practice and
a propensity that go far to account for
the follies of Saxonism. Happenings
and birdlore and bodeful and the like
are the products of a healthy revulsion
from the turgid taste that finds satisfac-
tion in such words as adumbrate,
ameliorate, and eventuate, and in the
many other ways that are described in,
for instance, ABSTRACTITIS, AVOIDANCE
OF THE OBVIOUS, LOVE OF THE LONG
WORD, PEDANTIC HUMOUR, PERIPHRASIS,
and -TiON WORDS. That the meaning of
many of the words and phrases fav-
oured by the anti-Saxonist is vague is
a recommendation to one kind of
writer as saving him the trouble of
choosing between words of more pre-
cise meaning, and to one kind of
reader as a guarantee that clear thought
is not going to be required of him.
say. 1. Except as a poeticism, the
noun survives only in such phrases as
to have a s. (to have the right to be
consulted) and to have said one's s. (to
have finished expressing one's opinion).
2 . The use of the verb's imperative to
introduce an hypothesis or an approxi-
mation (Let us meet soon—say next
Monday ; You will need some cash—say
saying
£5) is established idiom. 3. The ordi-
nary pronunciation of says (v.) is sez,
and it is odd that many writers of fic-
tion, including Kipling, should spell it
sez in dialogue by way of indicating
Irish brogue. 4 . For said or says So-
and-so see SAID.
saying. 'As the s. is', or 'goes', is often
used by simple people, speaking or
writing, who would fain assure us that
the phrase they have allowed to pro-
ceed from their lips or pen is by no
means typical of their taste in lan-
guage; it only happens to be 'so
expressive' that one may surely con-
descend to it for once. Well, qui
s'excuse s'accuse; if the rest of their
behaviour does not secure them from
insulting suspicions, certainly the apo-
logy will not. See SUPERIORITY.
scabies. Now usually two syllables:
skâ'bëz. See -IES, -EIN.
scallop, sco-. The spelling is usually
with -a-, but the pronunciation with
-o-. The verb makes -oping, -oped; see
- p - , -PP-.
scandalum magnatum. The second
word is the genitive plural of Latin
magnas a magnate, not a p.p. agreeing
with scandalum. The phrase means the
offence of uttering a malicious report
against some high official, and the use
of it in such senses as 'a crying scandal'
is a blunder.
scant, adj., is a LITERARY WORD, pre-
ferred in ordinary contexts to scanty,
small, few, short, etc., only by those
who have no sense of incongruity ( The
attendance was so scant as to suggest that
many members must have anticipated the
holiday). It survives as a current word,
however, in some isolated phrases,
as s. courtesy, s. attention, s. regard, and,
echoing Hamlet's mother, s. of breath.
scarce, adv., used instead of scarcely,
is a LITERARY WORD. It is true that the
OED says : 'Before adverbs in -ly the
form scarce is often adopted instead of
scarcely, to avoid the iteration of the
suffix.' On that iteration, see -LY; but
538 scene
such avoidance is a case of OUT OF THE

1. S. . . . than. S. was the nice new

sickened with diphtheria. For this con-
struction, condemned in OED (s.v.
than) as erroneous, see HARDLY 2 . The
ANALOGY of no sooner . . . than is no
doubt responsible. Before or when is
what should be used with scarcely.
2 . Not etc. . . . s. We most of us feel
safe against even saying ' I don't s.
know', with not and s. in hand-to-hand
conflict; but, if a little space intervenes,
and the negative is disguised, the same
absurdity is not very rare in print : The
services of the men who have worked the
railway revolution without the travel-
ling public being scarcely aware that we
are at war should not be forgotten, j It
has been impossible to tell the public s.
anything about American naval co-
operation with the British. The English
for without s. realizing is either s.
realizing, or without quite realizing, or
not fully realizing.
scarf. The dictionaries have not yet
decided whether to prefer the plural
-fs or -ves. In practice, -ves is probably
more usual for the article of clothing,
and -fs is invariable for the carpentry
term.
scavenge(r), w . Scavenger, n., is the
origin, in English, from which to
scavenge is a BACK-FORMATION, the
normal verb being to scavenger; cf. to
soldier, to filibuster, to buccaneer, to
privateer, to mountaineer, to volun-
teer, to solder, to bicycle, and hun-
dreds of other verbs that are in fact
verbal uses of nouns. Scavenge, how-
ever, is now much commoner than
scavenger as the verb.
scena (mus.)- Pronounce shâ'nah. But
the cognate and commoner scenario is
now anglicized into sënârio, at least in
the world of films.
scene. For synonyms in the sense
locale, see FIELD.
sceptic(al)
sceptic(al), scepsis, etc. The estab-
lished pronunciation is sk-, whatever
the spelling; and with the frequent
modern use of septic and sepsis (the
latter a I9th-c. word only), it is well
that it should be so for fear of con-
fusion. But to spell sc- and pronounce
sk~ is to put a needless difficulty in the
way of the unlearned, for see- is ordi-
narily pronounced se even in words
where the c represents a Greek k, e.g.
scene and its compounds and ascetic.
America spells sk-; we might pocket

schedule. Pronounce she'did in Bri-
tain; skë'dùl in U.S.
schismatic(al). See -IC(AL). The
short form is now ordinarily used for
the noun, and the long one for the
adjective.
schist. Pronounce sh~. The apparent
inconsistencies of English treatment
of Greek words are well illustrated by
schism (si-), schist (shï-), and the schizo-
compounds (ski- or skt-), all being from
the same Greek word. The explanation
is that only the last were consciously
taken direct from Greek ; the other two
came to us through French (scisme and
schiste).
schizomycetes. See MICRO-ORGAN-
ISMS.
scholar. Though there is no apparent
reason why s. and 55. should not mean
pupil(s) at a school, schoolboy, school-
girl, schoolchildren, etc., it is some-
thing of a solecism to use them in those
senses. A scholar at a school or univer-
sity is a pupil who holds a scholarship,
or, more loosely, one who is of scholar-
ship standard intellectually, and the
use of the word in the other sense
implies that the user is unacquainted
with school idiom. It is the sincere
hope of the council that its endeavour to
promote the 'sport' in the schools will be
recognized by the masters, and that they
will bring the proposed championships to
the notice of their scholars.

school (of fish etc.), shoal. The two
words are etymologically one, and
equally unconnected with the ordinary
word school; both are also current, and
without difference of sense except that
school is more usual for the cetacea;
a school of porpoises but a shoal of
herring.
sciagraphy etc., ski-. The regular
representative in English of Greek sk~
(here OKICL shadow) is sc-'s but it is
legitimate to pronounce c as k, cf.
SCEPTIC. This particular set of words
has been taken into English twice—in
the 16th c. as terms in perspective,
usually with the spelling sc-, and in
the 19th as equivalent to radiography
etc., usually with the spelling sk-. To
maintain both the sc- and the sk- forms
would have been very unsatisfactory,
and, with radiography in existence,
also needless. The X-ray sense has
now been properly abandoned to the
radio- words and the scia- words are
restricted to their older use in perspec-
tive, spelt only sc- and pronounced sk-.
science and a r t . S. knows, a. does;
a s. is a body of connected facts, an a.
is a set of directions; the facts of s.
(errors not being such) are the same
for all people, circumstances, and oc-
casions; the directions of a. vary with
the artist and the task. But, as there
is much traffic between s. and a., and,
especially, a. is often based on s., the
distinction is npt always clear; the a.
of self-defence, and the boxer's s.—
are they the same or different? The
OED, on s. 'contradistinguished from
art', says: 'The distinction as com-
monly apprehended is that a s. is con-
cerned with theoretic truth, and an a.
with methods for effecting certain re-
sults. Sometimes, however, the term
s. is extended to denote a department
of practical work which depends on
the knowledge and conscious applica-
tion of principles; an a., on the other
hand, being understood to require
merely knowledge of traditional rules
and skill acquired by habit.'
scilicet 540 Scotch
scilicet, usually shortened to scil. or
se, is Latin (scire licet you may know)
for 'to wit'. It is not so often misused
as e.g. and i.e., not having been popu-
larized to the same extent. Its function
is to introduce : (a) a more intelligible
or definite substitute, sometimes the
English, for an expression already
used: The policy of the I.W.W (sc.
Independent Workers of the World); The
Holy Ghost as Paraclete (scil. advo-
cate); (b) a word or phrase that was
omitted in the original as unnecessary,
but is thought to require specifying for
the present audience: Eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard (sc. the intent of
God). See also viz.
scintilla is rarely used except in the
singular (a s. of doubt; not a s. of
evidence) ; if a plural should be needed
it is sufficiently at home to make -as

land of origin, the pronunciation is

this so pronounce it. The place is pro-
nounced Skoon.
scope. For synonyms see FIELD.
score, n. (= 20). See COLLECTIVES 5.
scoria is a singular noun, pi. -iae; but,
as the meaning of the singular and of
the plural is much the same (cf. ash
and ashes, clinker and clinkers), it is no
wonder that the singular is sometimes
wrongly followed by a plural verb ( The
scoria were still hot etc.), or that a false
singular scorium is on record.
scotch. This verb owes its currency
entirely to the sentence in Macbeth—
'We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd
it' (Theobald's famous emendation of
scorch'd). The contrast between scotch-
ing (or disabling) and killing is ex-
pressly drawn in five quotations given
in the OED for the correct use, and is
understood to be implied even when it
is not expressed. S., then, can say in
six letters and in one syllable 'put tem-
porarily out of action but not destroy'
—a treasure, surely, that will be
jealously guarded by the custodians
of the language, viz. those who write.
But no; too many of them are so
delighted at finding in s. an uncommon
substitute for such poor common
words as kill or destroy to remember
that, if they have their way, the value
of a precious word will be not merely
scotched, but killed and destroyed, or,
as they would put it, 'finally scotched'.
Finally or entirely with s. should be, in
view of the history of 5., an impossi-
bility. But it is now to be met with
often in the newspapers ; and, after all,
a writer who, like the author of the
first extract below, does not know the
difference between a rumour and the
contradiction of a rumour, can hardly
be expected to recognize so super-
subtle a distinction as that between
wounding and killing : The contradic-
tion of a rumour affecting any particular
company, although it may have a certain
effect upon the price of shares at the
time, is seldom entirely scotched by
directorial statements. / Nine months
have gone by since the Crown Estate
Commissioners finally scotched rumours
that wholesale demolition of the Nash
Terraces in Regents Park was contem-
plated. I The idea is so preposterous
that by the time this is in print it may
be definitely scotched. These writers
might perhaps plead that they were
not using Macbeth's word but drew
their metaphor from the scotch, thought
to be of different origin, that is placed
under a wheel to prevent it from
moving. But the plea is not con-
vincing, and they cannot escape the
reproach of having in fact blunted the
point of a useful word.
Scotch, Scots, Scottish. 1. (as
adjj.). The third represents most
closely the original form, the first and
second being the contractions of it

adopted in England and Scotland
respectively. Scottish is still both good
English and good Scotch. The English
form Scotch had (OED, 1914) 'before
the end of the 18th c. been adopted
into the northern vernacular; it is used
regularly by Burns, and subsequently
by Scott. . . . Within the last half cen-
tury there has been in Scotland a
growing tendency to discard this form
altogether, Scottish, or less frequently
Scots, being substituted.' Regimental
titles vary: the King's Own Scottish
Borderers and the Scottish Rifles, but
the Scots Guards, the Royal Scots, the
Scots Fusiliers, and the Scots Greys.
Scots law and pound Scots are the only
forms. Out of deference to the Scots-
man's supposed dislike of Scotch, that
word has been falling into disuse in
England also, but it remains in both
countries in numerous associations,
e.g. whisky, broth, tweed, mist, terrier,

notion of uncanny effect, or to make

tates that kind of print, for the text of

542 seem
logy that derives the word from the
Latin seco (cut)—called by Skeat 'base-
less and unworthy of serious mention'
—is naturally interpreted as giving 'a
part cut away' from a Church etc., and
so a company of schismatics. Accord-
ing to the first, and probably correct,

the Roman Catholic Church, may be
called a s. without offence to its mem-

3. To my etc. seeming. An example of
the unsuitable use of this idiom is From
wherever he may start, he is sure to bring
us out very presently into the road along
which, to his seeming, our primitive
ancestors must have travelled. The
phrase to my etc. seeming has been
good English in its time; its modern
representative is to my etc. think-
ing, and to his seeming will pass
only in archaic writing. That the
author of the extract is an archaizer is
plain independently, from the phrase
seemly 543 self-
'very presently' (see PRESENTLY); but
he has no business to be archaizing in
a sentence made unsuitable for it by
the essentially unarchaic 'primitive
ancestors'.
4. As seem{s) to be the case. An
example of the wrong use of the
plural is How can the Labour Ministry
acquire proper authority if it has powers
so limited as seem to be the case? To
write as seem to be the case is al-
ways wrong, because the relative
pronoun as, for which see AS 5,
never represents an expressed plural
noun (such as powers here), but always
a singular notion like fact or state of
affairs, and that not expressed, but
extracted out of other words. As seems
to be the case is, then, the only right
form of the phrase; but even that will
not do here, because it involves the
doubling of two parts by as, that of the
relative adverb, indispensable after the
preceding so, and that of the relative
pronoun required by the otherwise
subjectless verb seems. What has hap-
pened is this. The writer wanted to
say if it has powers so limited as its
powers seem to be. He shied at the
repetition of powers, and felt about for
as seems to be the case as a substitute,
though he forgot to alter seem to seems.
But, since so makes the relative pro-
noun as impossible, the true solution
was to let the as be a relative adverb,
writing if its powers are so limited as
they seem to be.

the OED are seigneur, seignior;
seigneuress ; seigneury, seigneurie,

seign(i)or(i)al. The pronunciation in
all begins with s an followed by the y
sound. Differences in meaning or use
between alternative forms (as seigneur
and seignior, seigneury and seigniorage)
cannot be detailed here, but exist and
are sometimes of importance.
seise, seisin. Pronounce sëz, sê'ztn.
The words are sometimes (but less
often) spelt -ze, -zin, and belong ety-

The reflexive use of them = themselves
is archaic, and as such usually to be
avoided; but the following quotation is
enough to show that with an archaic
verb the archaic reflexive may be
more appropriate: Together the two—

selves to the loco, superintendent's
office. Read hied them to.
there. In the well-known special use
of there before be, exist, and such verbs,
two things call for notice. First, the
use is anticipatory, i.e. there accom-
panies and announces inversion of
verb and subject, standing in the place
usually occupied before the verb by
the subject; consequently, when there
is no inversion, this there is out of
place, and should be struck out, e.g.,
in : Bombay is without a doubt the head-
quarters of whatever cricket there exists
in India today. An exception must
however be made for the verb be itself;
'whatever cricket there is' is English,
though 'whatever cricket there exists'
is not. The reason is easy to see. In
inversions, there has become so regu-
lar an attendant on is, are, was etc.
when used as a substantive verb (i.e.=
exist) that even when there is no in-
version the need is felt of inserting it
as a sign that the verb must be taken
in its substantive sense, not as aux-
iliary or copulative. But with other
verbs, about which there is no such
doubt, no such sign is wanted, and
there is used only with inversion.
The second thing that calls for
notice is that, since in the there idiom
verb precedes subject, there is a danger
of the verb's being hastily put into
the wrong number; for examples see
NUMBER 7.
thereafter, thereat, therein, there-
of, thereto, therewith, etc. The re-
mark at the end of the article THERE-
FORE applies also to these compounds.
thereby. 1. The use of t. after a num-
ber etc. (half a dozen or t.) is Scottish,
the English idiom being or thereabouts
or or so. 2. A special tribunal will be

constituted to try the accused, thereby
assuring him the guarantees essential to
the right of defence. For this use of f.
with an UNATTACHED PARTICIPLE (as-
suring'S noun is not tribunal, but an
inferred constitution), see that article
and THUS, which is more frequently
resorted to in similar difficulties. In
the following example it is clear that
thereby means by the salary etc.; but
whether affording agrees with salary
etc., so that the salary affords encour-
agement by the salary, or whether it
agrees with 'firm' looming in the
distance, the writer probably knows
as little as we : The latter is usually the
recipient of a liberal salary and expenses,
with periodical increments, holidays, and
security, thereby affording every en-
couragement to promote the interests of

therefor, therefore. The two are
now distinct in accent and meaning
as well as in spelling. Therefor is
accented on the second syllable, there-
fore on the first; and therefor is to be
used only where for that, for it, for
them, etc., could stand equally well.
In grammatical terms, therefore is an
adverbial conjunction, and therefor an
adverbial or adjectival phrase (adver-
bial in He was punished therefor, and
adjectival in The penalty therefor is
death). The essential function of there-
fore is to make clear the relation of its
sentence to what has gone before; that
of therefor is the same as that of there-
after, thereat, therein, thereof, thereto,
therewith, etc., usual in legal documents
but elsewhere serving only to give a
touch of formality or archaism to the
sentence in which it is substituted for
the for it etc. of natural speech.
therefore. Apart from the danger of
meaning therefor and writing there-
fore or vice versa, the only caution
needed is that discretion is necessary
in the use of commas before and after
words of the class to which t. belongs.
Like then, accordingly, nevertheless,
consequently, and many others, it is an
adverb often used (itself, indeed, al-
most always) as a conjunction; and it is
a matter of taste whether such adver-
bial conjunctions shall or shall not be
comma'd off from the rest of the sen-
tence in which they stand. Light punc-
tuators usually omit the commas (or
comma, if t. stands first), heavy punc-
tuators usually give them, and both are
within their rights. But it must be re-
membered that the putting of a comma
before t. inevitably has the effect of
throwing a strong accent on the pre-
ceding word, and that some preceding
words are equal to that burden, and
some are not. From the three follow-
ing examples it will be at once apparent
that the although can bear the commas,
and the ands cannot: Although, there-
fore, the element of surprise could not
come into play on this occasion, the
Germans were forced to withdraw. \ It
would be impossible for the State to pay
such prices, and, therefore, we must con-
tent ourselves with . . . / Malaria was the
cause of a very large proportion of the
sickness, and, therefore, the disease de-
serves especial study by . . . .
Again, the word it is one that can
seldom be emphasized and conse-
quently abhors a comma'd therefore
such as foDows it in: It, therefore,
comes rather as a shock to find simul-
taneously in many papers this morning
articles declaring . . . / It, therefore,
behoves those who have made the pas-
sage of the Bill possible to attend once
more. But where emphasis can reason-
ably be laid on it, and it can mean 'it
more than others' or the like, the
commas become at least tolerable ; so :
It is a concrete and definite idea, the
embodiment of which in practicable
shape is by far the most urgent construc-
tive problem of international statesman-
ship; and it, therefore, calls for the
most careful examination.
Many words, however, are neither
naturally emphatic like although nor
naturally unemphatic like and and it;
and after them care should be taken
not to use the commas with therefore
except when emphasis is intended.
The personal pronouns are good ex-
amples; in the following, we ought to
be able to conclude from the commas
that 'we' are being deliberately con-
trasted with others who believe other-
they 635 they
wise : We, therefore, find great comfort
in believing that Canadian loyalty de-
pends not on ..., nor on . . . , but on ....
Probably that is the case, and the com-
mas are justified; but if the light punc-
tuation were generally accepted as the
rule with these adverbial conjunctions,
and commas used only when emphasis
on the preceding word was desired,
one of the numberless small points that
make for lucidity would be gained.
A curious specimen may be added:
We therefore are brought again to the
study of symptoms. Here it is obvious
that We is unemphatic ; but the writer,
though he has rightly abstained from
commas, has been perverse enough to
throw an accent on We by other means,
viz. by putting therefore before instead
of after are.

The grammar of the recently issued
appeal to the Unionists of Ireland,
signed by Sir Edward Carson, the
Duke of Abercorn, Lord Londonderry,
and others, is as shaky as its argwnents.
The concluding sentence runs: 'And we
trust that everybody interested will send
a contribution, however small, to this
object, thereby demonstrating their {sic)
personal interest in the anti-Home Rule
campaign*. Archbishop Whately used
to say that women were more liable than
men to fall into this error, as they ob-
jected to identifying 'everybody* with
'him*. But no such excuse is available
in this case. Undoubtedly grammar
rebels against their; and the reason for
using it is clearly reluctance to recog-
nize that, though the reference may be
to both sexes, the right shortening of
the cumbersome he or she, his or her,
etc., is he or him or his, as his and him
are used with a boldness surprising in
a government department in There
must be opportunity for the individual
boy or girl to go as far as his keenness and
ability will take him. Whether that
reluctance is less felt by the male is
doubtful; at any rate the OED quotes
examples from Fielding {Everyone in
the house were in their beds), Gold-
smith, Sydney Smith, Thackeray {A
person can't help their birth), Bagehot
{Nobody in their senses), and Bernard
Shaw. It also says nothing more severe
of the use than that it is 'Not favoured
by grammarians'. In colloquial usage
the inconvenience of having no com-
mon-sex personal pronoun in the
singular has proved stronger than re-
spect for the grammarians, and the one
that is available in the plural is made to
serve for the singular too. But in prose
their disfavour is not treated so lightly;
few good modern writers would flout
them so conspicuously as Fielding and
Thackeray did in the sentences quoted,
or as Ruskin in / am never angry with
anyone unless they deserve it. The
question is discussed in NUMBER I I :
examples of the wrong their, in addi-
tion to those that follow, will be found

change, it is needless to remark that
each, one, person, etc., may be answered
by her instead of him and his when the
reference, though formally to both
sexes, is especially, as here, to the
female.
2. Confusions with nouns of multi-
tude and personifications. What is
meant appears from the following
quotation, in which a noun of multi-
tude (section) is treated in the same
sentence first as singular {acknowledges)

though
those. 1 . For those kind of, those sort
of, see KIND.
2 . Those (adj.)+noun + adjective.
(The winner will be selected from) those
persons named', persons is the noun, and
named the adjective. This arrange-
ment is now very common but is so
little warranted by good literary usage
that the OED, which illustrates the
constructions of which this is a hybrid
product, does not quote a single ex-
ample of it; cf. what is said of the same
construction under THAT, adj. 2 . The
word adjective in the formula above is
to be taken as including participles
active or passive, and adjectival phrases,
as well as simple adjectives—whatever,
in fact, is equivalent to a defining rela-
tive clause (those persons following, those
persons named, those persons in the list
below, those persons present—all equiva-
lent to the persons that etc.). Those
named is a proper substitute for (the)
persons named, the pronoun (not adjec-
tive) those taking the place of the noun
persons with or without the, and (the)
persons named is itself a shortening of
the persons that are named. But those
persons named is a mixture of the long
form (the) persons that are named and
the short form those named, in which
mixture what was gained by using the
pronoun those instead of the persons is
thrown away by reinserting the noun
and making those an adjective. It is
true that there is another legitimate
form in which those does appear as an
adjective, viz. those persons who are
named; but that is a form in which what
is aimed at is not lightness and
brevity, but on the contrary formality
and precision; it is therefore not one
that should be abbreviated.
All this is offered not as a proof that
those persons named is impossible gram-
mar, but as a reasonable explanation
of what is believed to be the fact, that
good writers do not say it, but say
either (the) persons named or those
named. The following quotation is
useful as containing samples both of
the right and of the wrong usage : It
depends upon the extent to which those
in authority understand their responsi-
bility, and are able so to make their
influence felt as to enlist the active sup-
port of those boys with most influence
in the school. Those in authority is right,
whereas those persons in authority
would have been wrong; and those
boys with most influence is wrong, and
should be the boys with etc.
The following use of those is quite
another matter, and of no importance,
but worth giving as a curiosity: It
is impossible for the Ambassador to issue
invitations to those other than Ameri-
though. 1. Though, although. 2. As
though. 3. (Although with participle
or adjective. 4 . Illogical use.
1. Though, although. The definite
differences between the two hardly
need stating. They are: first that
though can and although cannot be used
as an adverb, placed last (He said he
would come; he didn't, though); and
secondly that though is alone possible
in the as though idiom. In the use
common to both forms, i.e. as a com-
plete conjunction, no definite line can
be drawn between them, and either
is always admissible. But it is safe to
say, in the first place, that though is
much commoner, and, secondly, that
the conditions in which although is
likely to occur are (a) in the more
formal style of writing, (b) in a clause
that does not follow but precedes the
main sentence, and perhaps (c) in
stating an established fact rather than
a mere hypothesis: He wouldn't take
an umbrella though it should rain
cats and dogs; Although he attained
the highest office, he zoas of mediocre
ability.
2 . As though. It is not as though
there has been cruelty and injustice. Had,
in place of has, is the only right Eng-
lish; see AS 4 for discussion and
examples.
3. (Although with participle or ad-
jective. Like other conjunctions (if,
when, while, etc.), (although is often
used with the significant word of its
thrash 638
clause alone, the subject and the
auxiliary or copulative verb being
readily supplied; so Though annoyed,
I consented. The convenience of this
is obvious, but care is needed, as ap-
pears from the two quotations that
follow: Though new to mastership her-
self, a lady master is not new to the pack,
for she follows Mrs. Garvey in the posi-
tion. I Though sympathizing as I do with
Poland, I cannot resist the impression
that it would be doing Poland an ill
service to. . . . The point shown by
the first is that the omission must not
be made when it leaves the participle
or adjective apparently attached to a
wrong noun. New in fact belongs to
she, but seems to belong to a lady
master; if she is had not been omitted
after though, all would have been in
order. In the Poland sentence, the
correction really required is to omit
though, 'sympathizing as I do' being
self-sufficient. But, even if we suppose
as I do omitted, there is a wrong sound
about though sympathizing itself that
suggests a limitation on this idiom.
Though, and other conjunctions, must
not be constructed with a participle
unless that participle would have been
used in the unabridged clause; and
that would not have been though I am
sympathizing, but though I sympathize.
Contrast with this the perfectly satis-
factory Though living he is no longer
conscious, where the full form would
be not Though he lives, but Though he
is living. See also IF.
4 . Illogical use. The danger of using
adversative conjunctions where two
propositions are not strictly opposed,
but in harmony, is explained and illus-
trated in BUT 3. In the following
example, though would be right if the
words 'is the only country in Europe
that' were not there; as it stands, the
sentence is nonsense : Though it is only
in recent times that in England, the Jewish
civil disabilities were repealed, Turkey
is the only country in Europe that has
throughout been free of any anti-Jewish
propaganda.
thrash, thresh. One word, with two
pronunciations and spellings differen-
through
tiated. To separate grain is almost
always -esh; to flog is always -ash', and
that is the usual spelling in figurative
and transferred use, e.g. thrash out a
problem.
Threadneedle Street, Old Lady of.
See SOBRIQUETS.
threaten. The Mass Vestments, now
threatened to be authoritatively revived,
have to be decided upon. See DOUBLE
PASSIVES.
three-quarter(s). The noun ex-
pressing a fraction has the -s, and,
though usually hyphened, is better
written as two separate words; see
HYPHENS. This noun is often used
attributively with another noun, e.g.
with back at rugby football, or with
length ox face in portraiture; in those
conditions a hyphen is required to
show that the adjective+noun has
become one word. But further, it is
usual, when a plural noun is used
attributively or compounded, to take
its singular for the purpose, even if
that singular does not otherwise exist
(billiard room, not billiards room ; scissor-
shaped, not scissors-shaped; racket-court,
not rackets-court). Accordingly, three-
quarter back and three-quarter face are
the normal forms. But the nouns back,
length, etc., are often dropped when
context allows, and the attributive
compound is allowed to represent
them as well as itself; a three-quarter
is now the usual football term.
threnody. See ELEGY.
thrive. The OED gives throve,
thriven, as the past and p.p., but
allows thrived for either.
through. The Americanism be through
with in the sense of be finished with is
recognized by the OED. Only Ameri-
can examples are given but it is now
common in Britain also, though still
a colloquialism in both countries. The
convenient American use of through in
such a phrase as from Monday through
Friday, meaning from Monday to
Friday inclusive, is still strange to us.
thus 639 time
thus. There is a particular use of
thus that should be carefully avoided.
In this use thus is placed before a
present participle (thus enabling etc.)»
and its function, when it is not purely
otiose, seems to be that of apologizing
for the writer's not being quite sure
what noun the participle belongs to,
or whether there is any noun to which
it can properly be attached (cf. UNAT-
TACHED PARTICIPLES); the exact con-
tent of thus itself is often as difficult to
ascertain as the allegiance of the parti-
ciple. To each quotation is appended
(1) a guess at the noun to which the
participle belongs, and (2) a guess at
the content of thus; the guesses are
honestly aimed at making the best of
a bad job, but readers may prefer other
guesses of their own: Our object can
only be successfully attained by the sub-
stantial contributions of wealthy sympa-
thizers, thus enabling us to inaugurate
an active policy (contributions? by
being substantial?). I But now a fresh
anxiety has arisen owing to the rising of
the Seine, thus making the river naviga-
tion more difficult and slow (rising? by
occurring?)./ Production rose quickly
from $m. tons in 1958 to over 13m. tons
last year, thus enabling Frondizi to
claim that the battle had been won
(production? By rising quickly?). It
should be noticed that the resolution
of the participle into a relative clause,
and the omission of thus, gets rid of
the difficulty every time (which would
enable; which makes; which enabled).
thyme. Pronounce tim; before the
17th c. the usual spelling was tyme or
time. But thymus and thymol are pro-
nounced th-.
tibia. Tib—in English, though ttb.

tic douloureux. The private founda-
tions develop tic douloureux trying to do

There are indications that the phrase
develop t. d.y signifying conscientious
endeavour carried to extremes, may be
on its way to replacing the outmoded
clichés strain every nerve and sinew,
explore every avenue, leave no stone un-
turned and their successor lean over
backwards. Its aptness may seem ques-
tionable to doctors, but it certainly
suggests even more devoted effort than
the old phrases. One may strain
nerves and sinews without doing one-
self any permanent harm, and turn
stones and explore avenues without
any ill effects, and lean over backwards
without overbalancing. But t. d. (trige-
minal neuralgia) is agonizingly painful,
and only the most dedicated enthusiasts
would risk 'developing' it, however
good the cause. The best pronuncia-
tion (pace OED, which says 'often
mispronounced') is tïk dôlôrôô'.
tilde (tï'ldë). The mark put over n

freemasonry are usually spelt with y,
but are not of different origin. See

till, until. The first is the usual
form; for what difference of usage
exists, see UNTIL.
tilth. A word not open to the remarks
made in -TH NOUNS, being very far in-
deed from a recent formation. It
differs, however, from the really com-
mon nouns in -th, such as truth and
wealth and filth: though still in use
for the depth of soil prepared by culti-
vation, it has become archaic in its
general meaning of tillage or tilled
land; and, being therefore a favourite
with those who affect poetic diction,
it has unfortunately begotten a pro-
geny that has not its parent's claims to
respect.
time. Under this, as the most general
term, may be collected some synonyms.
Of the six following words each is
given a single definition with a view
merely to suggesting the natural rela-
tion between them. Though each is
often used in senses here assigned not
to it but to another (or not mentioned
at all), the words aeon, date, epoch, era,
period, cycle, form a series when they
time-scale 640 -tion
are strictly interpreted, and to keep
that series in mind is helpful in choos-
ing the right word.
A11 aeon is an infinitely long period
of time.
A date is the identifiable or intelligibly
stated point of time at which some-
thing occurs.
An EPOCH is the date of an occurrence
that starts things going under new
conditions.
An era is the time during which the
conditions started at an epoch con-
tinue.
A period is an era regarded as destined
to run its course and be succeeded by
another.
A cycle is a succession of periods
itself succeeded by a similar succession.
A time, and an age, are words often
exchangeable with all or most of the
above, but less precise in meaning.
Cf. also the words term, span, spell,
season, duration, JUNCTURE, moment,
occasion.
time-scale. See TAUTOLOGY.
timous, timeous. It would be better
to omit the e; see MUTE E. Whereas its
sole function is to indicate the î sound,
the OED states that it actually results
in the erroneous pronunciations tï'mîus
and tï'mîus. But the Scots, now the
only users of the word, cling stub-
bornly to the e.
timpano, see TYMPANUM.
tinker, v. It was an undesirable thing
to be always tinkering with this particu-
lar trade. The idiomatic preposition
is at, not with; the latter, now at least
as common, is probably due to con-
fusion with tamper with, and illustrates
what was said in CAST IRON IDIOM about
the battle between analogy and idiom :
that analogy perpetually wins.
tint, shade, hue. All are available as
substitutes for the dominant word
colour. Different hues are, so far as
meaning goes, simply different colours,
so called because for good or bad
reasons the everyday word is held to
be unworthy of the context. Different
tints and shades are properly speak-
ing not different colours but varieties
of any particular colour, tints pro-
duced by its modification with various
amounts of white, and shades by various
admixtures of black. These distinc-
tions, however, are no longer observed;
shade (less commonly tint) is now the
usual word for the slightly different
varieties of what remains broadly the
same colour produced by an admixture
not merely of black or white but of any
other colour, e.g. a darker, or lighter,
or greener shade of blue. Hue and tint
retain certain special associations, e.g.
sunset hues, autumn tints, and for hair-
dressers and their customers tinting
has become a euphemism for dyeing.
-tion and other -ion endings. Turgid
flabby English is full of abstract nouns;
the commonest ending of abstract
nouns is -tion, and to count the -ion
words in what one has written, or,
better, to cultivate an ear that without
special orders challenges them as they
come, is one of the simplest and most
effective means of making oneself less
unreadable. It is as an unfailing sign
of a nouny abstract style that a cluster
of -ion words is chiefly to be dreaded.
But some nouny writers are so far from
being awake to that aspect of it that
they fall into a still more obvious dan-
ger, and so stud their sentences with
-ions that the mere sound becomes an
offence, as it does in Speculation on the
subject of the constitution of the British
representation at the Washington in-
auguration of the League of Nations
will, presumably, be satisfied when
Parliament meets. Position and situa-
tion, often in combination, are special
offenders. The situation in the in-
dustry has reached a tragic position (The
industry is in a tragic state)./ They based
this opinion largely on the position of the
company's financial situation (on the
state of the company's finances). / The
Trades Union Congress should call a
halt to the situation (should stop this)./
We ought to be told the present position
on this matter (how this matter now
stands)./ The position in regard to
unemployment has deteriorated (more
people are unemployed). / At the

is in a strange position (is strange).
Writers given to overworking these
words would be wise to try doing
without them altogether; they would
seldom find any great difficulty in it,
and they would have a salutiiry exer-
cise in clear thinking. See also AB-
STRACTITIS.
tipstaff. The OED prefers the plural
-staffs to -staves, and there seems no
good reason for applying the archaic
plural of STAFF to officials who are
still very much alive.
tiptoe, v., is, like hoe and shoe, an
exception to the MUTE E rule, and
makes tiptoeing.
tirade. The OED prefers tx- to tï-;
so does the COD, but it is questionable
whether this reflects the prevailing
practice.
tire, tyre. For other words in which
the same spelling question has arisen,
see Y AND 1. The OED regards the
word as a shortening of attire—the
wheel's attire, clothing, or accoutre-
ment; and it states the spelling facts
thus: 'From 15th to 17th c. spelt tire
and tyre indifferently. Before 1700
tyre became generally obsolete, and
tire remained as the regular form, as it
still does in America; but in Great
Britain tyre has been recently revived
as the popular term for the rubber rim
of. . . .' From this it appears that
there is nothing to be said for tyre,
which has no claim to be etymo-
logically preferable and is needlessly
divergent from our own older and the
present American usage. Some die-
hards, including The Times, made a
long stand against it, but its victory
seems now assured.
tiro, ty-. Spell ti-, and see Y AND I ;
pi. -os, see -O(E)S 6.
tissue. The OED gives precedence
to tï'shû over tï'sû; but the latter is
now regarded as the better pronuncia-
tion. It is clear, however, that the sh
sound prevailed in the 16th c , since h,
which can only be accounted for as
marking sound, occurs in quotations
to
from 1501 ; and this may be the reason
for the OED's choice.
titbit, tid-. The older spelling is
tid-; but it is now so much less usual
in Britain (though not in U.S.)3 and
the significance of tid is so doubtful,
that there is no case for reverting to it.
To make the two parts of such words
rhyme or jingle is a natural impulse
that need not be resisted unless it
involves real loss of meaning.
titillate (tickle the fancy) and titivate
(smarten up) are often confused. See

4 . Without hardly. Example: The
introduction of the vast new refineries
has been brought about quickly, silently,
and effectively3 and without the sur-
rounding community hardly being
aware of what was happening. Again,
like 2 , a common colloquialism, but,
unlike it, one that should never appear

5. Negative confusion. Like all
negative and virtually negative words,
without often figures in such absur-
dities as : It is not safe for any young
lady to walk along the Spaniards-road
on a Sunday evening by herself without
having unpleasant remarks spoken as she

wizened, wizen, weazen. All three

wont(ed). Wont, the pp. of an
obsolete verb won (meaning to be
accustomed to) is still used as a pre-
dicative adjective (as he was wont to do).
The participial origin of the word
having been forgotten, wont was used
as a verb (Talbot whom we wont to
fear) and given a past participle of its
own, wonted—an experience similar to
that of hoise and HOIST. In its other
parts the verb is no longer used, but
wonted survives as an attributive
adjective (he showed his wonted skill).
There is also a noun wont (as was his
wont), a partner in the SIAMESE TWIN
use and wont. The traditional pro-
nunciation wunt, useful as differentia-
ting this word from the abbreviation of
will not, has been preserved in U.S.,
but in England (though not in
Scotland) wont has displaced it.
wood. Woodbine, not -bind, is the
established form, especially with Shak-
speare and Milton to maintain it. To-

woof, warp, web, weft. The warp
is a set of parallel threads stretched
out vertically; the threads woven hori-
zontally between these are the woof or
weft ; and the fabric that results is the
web.
wool makes, in British spelling, wool-
len, woolly, and in American woolen,

word-patronage. Under SUPERIO-
RITY, the tendency has been mentioned
to take out one's words and look at
them and to apologize for expressions
that either need no apology or should
not have been used. To pat one-
self on the back instead of apologizing
for one's word is a contrary manifesta-
tion of the same weakness, viz. self-
consciousness. It is rare, but perhaps
deserves this little article all to itself:
That is a contingency which has been
adumbrated (to revive a word which
has been rather neglected of late);

He died believing he had solved the

work, vb. The decline of the form
wrought is so manifest, yet so far from
complete, that it is impossible to say
from year to year where idiom still
requires it and where it is already
archaic. A few sentences with blanks
for wrought or worked will illustrate. As
the direction of progress is clear, pru-
dence counsels falling in with it in

wrought does not mean the same as
overworked, and wrought remains un-
challenged in wrought-iron.
workaday is now displaced, wholly
in the noun use, and for the most part
as an adjective, by the normal work-
day, of which it is regarded as a slip-
shod pronunciation to be used only as
a genial unbending. To the extent that
it survives (e.g. This workaday world)
it differs from workday in connoting
the humdrum element in work—'the
trivial round, the common task'. Or
it may serve, like pedestrian, as a
patronizing term of disparagement—
his workaday talents.
working and stylish words. No
one, unless he has happened upon this
article at a very early stage of his
acquaintance with this book, will sup-
pose that the word stylish is meant to
be laudatory. Nor is it; but neither is
this selection of stylish words to be
taken for a blacklist of out-and-out
undesirables. Many of them are stylish
only when they are used in certain
senses, being themselves in other senses
working words; e.g., VIABLE is a work-
ing word to apply to a newly formed
organism, though nothing if not stylish
when used to indicate that a political
programme is practicable ; initiate is a
working word for formal admission to
an office or society though stylish as a
mere synonym for begin; DEEM is a
working word in the sense in which
lawyers use it, though stylish for
think. Others again, such as bodeful
and dwell and perchance, lose their
unhappy stylish air when they are in
surroundings of their own kind,
where they are not conspicuous like an
escaped canary among the sparrows.
What is to be deprecated is the notion
that one can improve one's style by
using stylish words, or that important
worn-out humour
occasions necessarily demand impor-
tant words. The motorist before the
magistrate does not improve his
chances of acquittal by saying / ob-
served that I should not impede her
progress when he means / saw that I
should not get in her way. The words
in the list below, like hundreds of
others, have, either in certain senses
or generally, plain homely natural
companions; the writer who prefers
the stylish word for no better reason
than that he thinks it stylish, so far
from improving his style, makes it
stuffy, or pretentious, or incongruous.

worn-out humour. 'We are not

worn-out humour
stated a fact that was disconcerting to
someone. Yet the thing was very likely
amusing in its nature ; it did not amuse
the person whose amusement mattered,
that was all. The writer's Queen Vic-
toria is his public, and he would do
well to keep a bust of the old Queen
on his desk with the legend 'We are
not amused' hanging from it. His
public will not be amused if he serves
it up the small facetiae that it remem-
bers long ago to have taken delight in.

of worn-out humour exhibited below

worsened words. Changes in the
meaning of words, and still more in
their emotional content, often reflect
changes of opinion about the value of
what they stand for. Occasionally a
pejorative word becomes commenda-
tory—BAROQUE and prestige for in-
stance—but much more often it is the
other way about. Imperialism was de-
fined at the end of the 19th c. as 'a
greater pride in empire, a larger patriot-
ism' ; in the middle of the 20th it was
described as 'a word so charged with
hostile meaning as to be almost use-
less.' Colonialism has a different signi-
ficance today from what it had when
we prided ourselves on carrying the
white man's burden. The degradation
of BOURGEOIS and capitalist is notorious,
and class, as a social term, has become
unmentionable (see GROUP). Appease-
ment has suffered a similar change:
there is no hint in the OED definitions
of anything discreditable or humiliat-
ing about that word. No one thought
any the worse of Aeneas for letting
Cerberus have his usual sop. Under
the influence of EUPHEMISM the blame-
less word EPITHET is becoming ob-
jurgatory, and the second world war
has taken the virtue out of collaborator.
Not until the 1933 supplement
appeared did the OÈD contain any
suggestion that academic could be
used in a derogatory sense, reflecting
the view, widely held today, that
acquiring knowledge is a waste of
worser 719 worth
time unless it is a means of material
advancement. Hypothesis seems to be
going the same way. 'Today', says
Medawar, 'the pejorative use of hypo-
thesis {Evolution is only an h.; It's only an
h. that smoking causes lung cancer) is a
sign of semi-literacy.' Some old people
may regret that a pop singer no longer
means quite what it did in the days
when Santley and Sims Reeves sang in
St. James's Hall, and that a pop
concert is no longer likely to consist of
'a series of masses and fugues and "ops"
by Bach interwoven with Spohr and
Beethoven'. Possibly the waning of our
conviction that all progress must be
beneficial will bring a converse ex-
perience to that now highly pejorative
word REACTIONARY. It must also be
some change in our national character
—perhaps our greater reserve and
selfconsciousness—that explains why
many words, once reputable, are now
seldom used by educated people
except on a note of parody: such
are buxom, gallant, genteel, intrepid,
sinful, virtuous, winsome.
This article is concerned only with
a few modern examples of a
process that goes on ceaselessly,
imperceptibly, and uncontrollably.
Looking farther back, we should find
many more words that have had simi-
lar experiences. A small sample i s :

worser. Of this double comparative
the OED says: 'Common in the 16th
and 17th ce. as a variant of worse in all
its senses. In modern use it is partly
a literary survival, especially in
phrases like the worser part, sort, half,
and partly dialect and vulgar,' illus-
trating the last from Dickens: Your
poor dear wife as you uses worser nor a
dog. For the analogous lesser see LESS.
worth, worth while. 1. In certain uses
great confusion prevails, which can be
cleared up with the aid of grammar.
The important fact is that the adjective
worth requires what is most easily de-
scribed as an object. It is meaningless
to say This is worth, but sense to say
This is worth sixpence, or This is worth
saying (i.e. the necessary expenditure
of words), or This is worth while (i.e.
the necessary expenditure of time).
But one such object satisfies its require-
ments, so that This is worth while say-
ing, with the separate objects while and
saying, is ungrammatical.
2 . Worth with two objects. There is
no need to give more than two
examples of this mistake; all that is
necessary to set them right is to omit
while, leaving worth with one object
only—turning in the first and pursuing
in the second. A spare captain, to take
charge of any prize that might be worth
while turning into a raider. / Was not
that a line worth while pursuing?
3. Worth with no object. The
commonest cause of this mistake is the
anticipatory it; see IT I and 2 . As is
there explained, the function of the
anticipatory it is to herald a deferred
subject. It follows that such a sentence
as It is worth saying this is equivalent
to 'It, namely saying this, is worth';
worth is left without an object, and
nonsense results. Such sentences, if
they are short and simple, can be
corrected in one of two ways : either
by getting rid of the it or by inserting
while. It is worth quoting the 'Echo de
Paris' can be rewritten either The
'Echo de Paris' is worth quoting or It is
worth while to quote etc. It is worth
dwelling 011 this method of approach can
be rewritten either This method of
approach is worth dwelling on or It is
worth while to dwell on etc. For longer
and more complex sentences the
insertion of while may be the only
remedy, as in It is worth recalling Lord
Salisbury's declaration in 188$ that,
if she yielded to pressure, we would
consider ourselves released from our
obligations.
3. If an initial it is not anticipatory
but an ordinary pronoun the case is of
course quite different. In / have said
this because it is zvorth saying 'it' is a
pronoun whose antecedent is 'this'
worth 720
and worth is rightly given only one
object—saying', to write it is worth
while saying would give it two. The
following quotation shows the risk of
confusion : In your excellent account of
the late Miss there is one omission, and
it is worth filling it up. Here the first it
is anticipatory, meaning 'filling it up'
and the second is the ordinary pro-
noun, meaning 'the omission'. If the
second is left out the first takes over
its job; the sentence becomes It (i.e.
the omission) is worth filling up, and all
is well.
4 . It is true that in some sentences
in which an anticipatory it is used
there are two possible views of what
It stands for. It is worth while re-
marking that the Greek National
Anthem is really a very interesting and
harmonious air. j It is worth while
pointing out that out of an electorate of
nearly fourteen and a half millions no
fewer than four and a quarter million
votes were recorded in 1912 for the
Socialist candidates. Does the first
quotation mean that 'it' (i.e. remarking
this fact about the anthem) is worth
while, or that 'it' (i.e. this fact about
the anthem) is worth while remark-
ing? Does the second mean that 'it'
(i.e. pointing out this fact about the
election) is worth while or that 'it'
(i.e. this fact about the election) is
worth while pointing out? If the
former, the sentences are gram-
matically correct, if the latter they are
not. But the meaning is substantially
the same in either case, and we may
be content to give the writer the
benefit of the doubt.
5. A complication is sometimes intro-
duced by a relative clause. The Chinese
Labour Corps and its organization was
one of the side issues of the war zohich is
well worth while to hear about. The
skeleton of this, before subordination
by the relative, is : The Corps was a side
issue; to hear about this (issue) is worth
while, or it is worth while to hear about
this. Subordination by the relative
should give accordingly either to hear
about which is worth while, or which it
is worth while to hear about. But the
writer has taken that anticipatory it,
worthy
(= to hear about which) for the ordi-
nary pronoun it (— this issue), and
has therefore left it out because he sup-
poses it to mean only the same thing as
the which that is to connect the clause;
the result is that his which is both sub-
ject to is (which he has deprived of its
it) and object to about. Correct gram-
mar would be either which is well
worth hearing about, or which it is
well worth while to hear about, or which
it is well worth while hearing about.
6. Although the use of the gerund
with worth while is not incorrect
(w. w. hearing about), the infinitive
(w. w. to hear about) is more idiomatic.
worth-while. This attributive-ad-
jective compound extracted from the
phrase 'is worth while' (a worth-while
experiment from the experiment was
worth while) is not without its uses;
but, having been seized upon as a
VOGUE WORD, it is fast losing all pre-
cision of meaning : That motherhood is
a full-time job all worth-while mothers
will readily admit. / An attractive pro-
gramme of worth-zuhile topics has been
arranged for discussion. Like rewarding
in a similar sense, it is a popular word
with schoolmasters.
worthy. 1 . As an adjective meaning
possessed of estimable qualities, w. is
a WORSENED WORD, seldom used
except patronizingly.
2 . The construction in which zv. was
treated like worth and like, governing
a noun (in words worthy the occasion;
a deed worthy remembrance, without
of), is now rare, and appropriate only
in exalted contexts.
3. The suffix -worthy is described by
the OED as 'an adjective employed
as a second element in a number of
compounds of which only a few have
come into regular use'. The large
number that have not survived, some
dating from the 12th c , include death-,
faith-, fame-, fault-, honour-, labour-,
laugh-, mark-, name-, paint-, sale-,
scorn-, song-, teach-, thank-, wonder-,
and worship-. Of the few that have
established themselves, blame- dates
from the 14th c , note- and praise- from
the 16th, battle-, road- and sea- from
would
the 19th and air- from the 20th. New
formations are now mostly jocular,
as when a piece of information is
pronounced newsworthy, or something
suitable for broadcasting on the BBC
Third Programme said to be third-
worthy, or a parliamentary candidate
called Westminster-worthy, or the name
for a new type of car is chosen as being
sales-zoorthy.
would. See WILL (vb.) and SHALL AND
WILL.
wove, p.p., instead of the usual woven,
is chiefly in commercial terms, as wove
paper, hard-wove fabrics, wire-wove.
wrack. See RACK.
wrapt, wrapped, rapt. See RAPT
for the confusion between the English
adjective made from Latin raptus and
the p.p. of wrap. It is as well that the
form wrapt seems to be disappearing,
so that writers will have to make up
their minds between rapt and wrapped.
wrath, wrathful, wroth. It is very
desirable that differentiation should
be clearly established, though all smack
of WARDOUR STREET. The OED should
be consulted on the history of these
words ; but it may safely be said (1) that
many people ignore the existence of
wroth and treat wrath as both noun
and adjective, pronouncing it always
rawth, and (2) that the useful arrange-
ment would be for wrath to be noun
only = anger and pronounced rawth,
and for wroth to be the adjective =
angry and pronounced roth. This does
not put wrathful out of use; it is the
attributive adjective, and wroth is the
predicative : A wrathful god, but God
was wroth. For wroth, the pronuncia-
tion roth is better not only than rawth,
but also than rôth, because much more
easily distinguishable from the rawth
of wrath.
wreath. Pronounce the plural -dhz;
see -TH AND -DH for this, and for

721 wrought
1. W. with personal object. In / will
write you the result, there are two
objects, the result (direct object), and
you (indirect object). In literary Eng-
lish an indirect object is used after
write only if there is also a direct object,
but the direct object may be used
without an indirect ; that is, / will write
the result^ and / will write you the result,
are idiomatic, but / will write you
soon, or about it, is not. If a direct
object is wanting, the person written
to must be introduced by to: I will
write to you about it. In commercial use

at your convenience, etc., are estab-
lished but avoided elsewhere. The
following from a novel is to be
condemned: The Lady Henrietta, she
who was to keep him out of Arcadia,
and who believed him to be in Cannes
or Mentone, wrote him regularly
through his bankers, and once in a while
he wrote her. U.S. idiom is different;
there the use of the indirect object
without the direct (I will write you
soon) is standard usage.
2 . Writ large. The famous line
New Presbyter is but old Priest writ
large (Milton, Sonnet On the New
Forcers of Conscience . . .) owes its
fame to its double sense; priest and
presbyter being derived alike from
Greek rrpeofivTepos, the second word
is literally a larger writing of the first;
metaphorically, a presbyter turns out
to be a priest, only more so. Nowadays,
whenever a reform disappoints, the
new state is said to be the old writ
large; but, as circumstances seldom
allow the literal sense as well as the
other, some wrong is done to the in-
ventor of the phrase by blunting its
point.
wrong is one of the words whose
adverbial use should be remembered;
did his sum wrong, guessed wrong, etc.,
are better than with wrongly, but a
wrongly done sum. See UNIDIOMATIC
-LY.
wroth. See WRATH.
wrought. See WORK.
wych- 722
wych-, wich-, witch-, in zo.-elm etc.
The first and third forms are those
usually seen, though the second is
nearest to the earliest spelling voice
(= drooping). Of the current forms
wych- has the real advantage of not
suggesting connexion with witches,
and is recommended.
X
-x, as French plural. It is still usual,
in varying degrees, to write -x instead
of the English -s in the plurals of words
in -eau and -eu borrowed from French,
the pronunciation being -z, as in Eng-
lish plurals. It is to be hoped that
some day all of these that are in familiar
English use will be anglicized with - s ;
but a list of the chief words, here given
with an English plural in order that
the reader may judge of their looks, is
admittedly forbidding: adieus; beaus;
châteaus; flambeaus; plateaus; port-
manteaus; rouleaus; tableaus; trous-
seaus. The fact, however, that purlieu,
which has all the air of a French word
without being one, looks right with
the plural -s (purlieus) because we are
used to it suggests that courage with
the others might soon be rewarded.
For all of them except beau, chateau,
and tableau the COD admits a plural
in -s. as an alternative. Phrases such
as feux de joie and jeux d'esprit would
naturally keep their French -x, and so
would any single words whose angli-
cization was so far from accomplished
that the plural was still pronounced
like the singular, without the sibilant;
that is hardly true of any of the list
above; we say not 'bo like BrummelT,
but 'bôz like BrummelT, and 'port-
mantôz are out of fashion', not 'port-
mantô. . . .'
-xion, -xive. About certain nouns,
especially connexion, deflection, in-
flexion, and reflection, there is a doubt
whether they should be spelt with
-xion or -ction, and the adjectives in
-ive are also concerned. The forms
connexion, deflexion, inflexion, and re-
flexion, are all called by the OED the
'etymological spellings'. In the first
y andi
place, each is derived from an actual
Latin noun in -xio, the change to
English -ction being due partly to the
influence of the verbs connect and de-,
in-, re-, fleet, and partly to that of the
multitude of English nouns in -tion;
and secondly, a vast majority of nouns
in -ion were formed from the p.p. stem
and not from the present stem of
Latin verbs, so that flecto flex-, and
necto nex-, would be expected to use
flex- and nex- as the basis of their
-ion nouns. As a few Latin nouns in
-io were nevertheless formed from
present stems, e.g. oblivio, the philo-
logical lapse is of no great importance.
It may be well to retain the x in con-
nexion, deflexion and inflexion, in which
it has by no means gone out of use,
though the earlier connexive has been
displaced by connective. For reflection
and reflexion, reflective, and reflexive,
with which attempts at differentiation
have had unequal success, see the
separate articles.
Y
-y. For the suffix used in making
adjectives from nouns ( racy etc.), as it
affects spelling, see -EY AND -Y IN
ADJECTIVES. For the diminutive suffix
(bookie, doggie, etc.), see -EY, -IE, -Y, IN
PET NAMES.
y and i were in older English writing
freely interchanged; that general
liberty has long been abandoned,
but there are still a few words in
which usage varies or mistakes are
common; they are, in the spelling
here recommended as the better,
though not in all cases (e.g. tire) the
prevailing one in Britain: cider,
CIPHER; GYPSY; Libya(n); LICHGATE;
Mytilene; pygmy; SIBYL; SILLABUB;
SILVAN; siphon; SIREN; STILE (in
hedge) and style (manner); STYMIE;
TILER; TIRE (of wheel); tiro; WYCH-
elm.
In Libya, sibyl, and Mytilene, the
right spelling is indisputable, but
with the same sound in successive
syllables it is difficult to remember
which is i and which y; even those
yankee 723
who have read Herodotus and Thucy-
dides often have to visualize the Greek
words before they feel safe. Lydia
makes them pause over Libya, and, as
a name in current use, Sybil, is com-
moner than Sibyl. In cypher, lychgate,
syllabub, sylvan, syphon, syren, and
tyro, the intrusive y is probably due to
a vague feeling that an unEnglish-
looking word is all the better for a
little aggravation of its unEnglishness.
In tyler and tyre differentiation may
have been at work, but without need;
and on tyre it may be added that, in
some people's opinion, to say that tire
is the American spelling is a sufficient
reason for our using tyre. On the con-
trary, agreement between English and
American spelling is much to be de-
sired wherever it is practicable. In
gipsy and pigmy, we have dissimi-
lation, again without need; for if
invisibility can carry five is, these can
surely do with two .vs. But the fact
that stymie has prevailed over both
stimy and stymy illustrates the power
of dissimilation; and it may be guessed
that the y starts in the oftener used
stymied, in which the necessary i of the
second syllable tends to produce y in
the first; with this compare the greater
frequency of the correct y in gypsies
and pygmies than in gypsy and pygmy.
On the words in the list that are in
small capitals, further remarks will
be found in the separate articles.
yankee. The mistaken practice of
applying this term to any citizen of the
U.S.A. dies hard in Britain. Yankee
was originally the nickname of those
who lived in New England ; at its most
comprehensive a hundred years later
it was extended contemptuously by
the confederates during the civil war
to all soldiers of the federal armies.
The derivation of the word, like those
of JAZZ and O.K., has been the subject
of much discussion and little agree-
ment.
yclept. See WORN-OUT HUMOUR.
ye. This archaic form of the, now
only in jocular use, should properly
be pronounced the, not ye, the y being
yet
not our letter, but a representation of
the obsolete single letter (b, called
thorn) now replaced by th.
year. Phrases such as last year, next
year, may be either nouns or adverbs
(Next year may be warmer', We may
have warmer weather next year) ; they
should not be both at once, as in:
The quinquennium ending and including
last year. The 'last year' that the quin-
quennium included was a noun; the
'last year' that the quinquennium
ended was an adverb ; indeed, far from
the quinquennium's ending the year,
the year ended the quinquennium. It
is the same kind of mistake as making
one word serve twice in two different
cases, for which see CASES 3 D. For the
use of an apostrophe in e.g. Five years'
imprisonment see POSSESSIVE PUZZLES 6,
and for The first time in years see IN I .
yellow-(h)ammer. It cannot be said
with safety either that the h is due to
ignorant assimilation by popular ety-
mology to hammer, or that the absence
of h is mere /z-dropping. Each form
has an etymological theory on its side,
and OED says that both forms 'are
historically justifiable'. The only
reason for resisting the prevalent h is
thus removed.
yeoman. Yeoman service and yeo-
man's service are both idiomatic, but
the greater ease of the former has
naturally made it the usual form.
y ester-. Other combinations than
yesterday are incongruous except in
verse or in designedly poetic prose.
It is true that yestereve is shorter than
yesterday evening, but the saving of
space is paid for by the proof that one
has no literary sense.
yet. 1. As an adversative adverb or
conjunction (= nevertheless, for all
that) yet is particularly liable to two
misuses. One of these-^-its tendency to
inspire foolish inversions—has been
specially treated in INVERSION under
the heading Yet, Especially, Rather.
The other is what may be called its
illogical pregnant use. When yet is
used to point a contrast, the opposi-
yet 724 zinc
tion between the fact it introduces and
that which has gone before should be
direct and clear. Examples of failure
in this respect must necessarily be of
some length; some simpler specimens
of a rather similar kind will be found
under BUT 3. In each of those that
follow it will be noticed that the
particular fact with which the Yet sen-
tence is in contrast is by no means
the essential contents of the previous
sentence, but has to be got out of it at
the cost of some thought. We confess
to being surprised at the line taken by
the railwaymen at Crewe with reference
to Colonel Yorkers conclusion that the
Shrewsbury disaster occurred through
the engine-driver having momentarily
fallen asleep. Yet at a meeting the Crewe
railwaymen are very indignant at the
suggestion, and denounce Colonel Yorke
as an Army officer who does not under-
stand the real working of railways. Here
the Yet fact is that the men are indig-
nant. What is that in contrast with?
Apparently with the correctness of
Colonel Yorke's conclusion; but,
though many other things not in con-
trast with their indignation can be got
out of the sentence, the correctness of
the conclusion is inferable only from
the newspaper's surprise at the men's
indignation at the conclusion. If yet
were omitted, the second sentence
would come in logically enough as an
explanation of what the men's 'line*
referred to had actually been.
Sir, I doubt if sufficient attention has
been drawn to the injustice of throwing
on the landlord in whose house they hap-
pen to be resident the cost of a large
additional insurance benefit for those
who are sick. Yet, under Clause $1, a
sick tenant would be able to live rent
free for a year at the expense of his or her
landlord. This is a less glaring case.
The essence of the Yet sentence is that
a tenant has power to injure a land-
lord. What is that in contrast with?
With the fact that justice should protect
landlords; that is, not with the main
sentencepreceding,whichisa statement
of why the writer is writing, but with
a mere inference from a noun that
occurs in it, viz. 'injustice'. As in the
first example, the logical work of the
second sentence is to explain the nature
of a noun contained in the first, but
an explanation is presented in the
guise of contrast; the sentence would
do its work properly if yet were omit-
ted. No doubt the contrast that was at
the back of the writer's mind, but did
not come to the front of it, was between
the greatness of the injustice and the
lack of public interest in it.
2 . Yet in its temporal sense may be
ambiguous: its old sense of 'now as
before', 'still' has lasted longer in
Scotland and Ireland than in England.
To a Scotsman or Irishman the natural
meaning of 'Is it raining yet?' is 'Is it
still raining?' To an Englishman it is
'Has it yet begun to rain?'
yiddish is not a kind of Hebrew, but
a kind of German. It is the language

consisting mainly of German (orig.
from the Middle Rhine area) with
admixture of Balto-Slavic or Hebrew
words and written in Hebrew char-
acters.

zinc, n. and vb. Inflexions and deriva-
tives give trouble with spelling and
pronunciation, especially those in
which an e, i, oty follows the c, and so
converts its natural pronunciation to s.
Zinced and zincing are clearly anoma-
lous; verbs ending c normally make
these inflexions -ck- so that there shall
be no mistake about the pronunciation
—e.g. trafficking, picnicked. But in
zmgaro 725 -z-
compounds and derivatives the c with
an s sound may be tolerated, e.g.
physicking but physicist. The forms

-z-, -zz-. In buz(z), fiz(z), friz(z),
quiz, and whiz{z), there is no need for a
second z, and when it appears it is
doubtless due to the influence of in-
flected forms like buzzer, quizzed, and
whizzing, in which it serves to show
that ï and u, not î and û, are the sounds.
But in fact the behaviour of these
words is capricious. Quiz alone firmly
dispenses with the second z. Friz(z)
(of hair) and whiz{z) vacillate. Buzz,
fizz, and frizz (of the noise from a
frying-pan) retain that form, perhaps
because of the onomatopoeic sugges-
tion of the double z. For the same
reason the newcomer, jazz, is un-
likely to change to on
